Yes, the consumer of node.properties/capabilities is the Nova driver, and it will be the consumer of the node.capabilities too. As for the API we will always support adding a field called ""capabilities"" in the node's properties because that's a JSON file and operators can add any key/value pairs they want there.

Now, the real backward compatibility layer is in Nova. The nova driver uses a specific version of the Ironic API (current 1.9 because it's implicit in the ironicclient, and we agreed to pin it to a specific version [0] explicitly too). So by ""backward compatible"" here I mean, updating nova to use a the new version of the API which contain the node.capabilities field, but also make it fallback and look at node.properties/capabilities in case the other field is empty.

As for the log, yes we probably should only log a warning if the user is using a version of the API that contains the node.capabilities field.

For the nova-show, Ironic will just show things as-is. We can't forbid someone to create a field called ""capabilities"" inside properties. So Ironic will just show things as-is, if node.capabilities is fulfilled it will show it and if node.properties/capabilities is fulfilled Ironic will show it too (it's not mutual exclusive)

OH. I guess regardless of the above, cuz we added a node.capabilities, we'll need an API version bump anyway.

As removing the target too early is a Cinder issue and it's currently specific to the lvm driver as far as I know.

And there's already a bug reported for this issue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1471278 This is why the 'Pass host to Cinder' patch was needed.

The disconnect_volume issue is on Nova side, we call out to os-brick immediately so the initiator is removed during the first detach. My best guess would be to check in check_detach whether there's another attachment on the host or not and pass the result to the virt_driver and call out to os-brick or not based on that.

FYI - I think mock.ANY is similar to mox.IgnoreArg(). I'm not suggesting you change your patch to use it, but it is an alternative middle ground.

Of those three options, I still think the simplest one is the best in this case (call_count).

See, `assertSequenceTrue` and `assertSequenceFalse` can be useful not only for integration tests but for unittests too. But you implement it for integration tests only. That's why it will be cool to code `assertSequenceTrue` and `assertSequenceFalse` inside `horizon.test.helpers` - it's higher abstraction level. But integration tests are inherited from `testtools.TestCase` (see `openstack_dashboard.test.integration_tests.helpers.BaseTestCase`), but unittests are inherited from `django.test.TestCase` (see `horizon.test.helpers.TestCase`). So integration tests and unittests don't have common ancestor, inside which we can implement `assertSequenceTrue` and `assertSequenceFalse`. So it's better to use mixin. You should implement `class AssertsMixin` inside `horizon.test.helpers`:

    class AssertsMixin(object):

        def assertSequenceTrue(self, actual):
            return self.assertSequenceEqual(actual, [True] * len(actual))

        def assertSequenceFalse(self, actual):
            return self.assertSequenceEqual(actual, [False] * len(actual))

and mix it, where you need (in this case mix with `openstack_dashboard.test.integration_tests.helpers.BaseTestCase`):

    from horizon.test.helpers import AssertsMixin

    class BaseTestCase(testtools.TestCase, AssertsMixin):



P.S.
! Please note, that I use self.assertSequenceEqual during implementation. It's because django.test.TestCase and testtools.TestCase have this assert method:

    In [9]: import testtools

    In [10]: import django.test

    In [11]: filter(lambda method_name: method_name == 'assertSequenceEqual', dir(testtools.TestCase))
    Out[11]: ['assertSequenceEqual']

    In [12]: filter(lambda method_name: method_name == 'assertSequenceEqual', dir(django.test.TestCase))
    Out[12]: ['assertSequenceEqual']

They have `assertSequenceEqual` because they are based on `unittest.TestCase`, which has such method:

    In [15]: testtools.TestCase.__mro__
    Out[15]: 
    (testtools.testcase.TestCase,
     unittest2.case.TestCase,
     unittest.case.TestCase,
     object)

    In [16]: django.test.TestCase.__mro__
    Out[16]: 
    (django.test.testcases.TestCase,
     django.test.testcases.TransactionTestCase,
     django.test.testcases.SimpleTestCase,
     unittest.case.TestCase,
     object)

    In [17]: import unittest

    In [18]: filter(lambda method_name: method_name == 'assertSequenceEqual', dir(unittest.TestCase))
    Out[18]: ['assertSequenceEqual']

And `assertSequenceEqual` implementation:

    In [22]: import inspect

    In [23]: print inspect.getsource(unittest.TestCase.assertSequenceEqual)

If the intent of this spec is to also remove the flavor entry in the server response dict, so you can't find the flavor ID in the server response, then I think it needs to explicitly call that out.",False,21

With the new resource-providers schema, the representation of all consumable resources is standardized, which means that we could have the following returned in the servers/{id} response:

 {
 ...
   ""resources"": {
     ""VCPU"": 4,
     ""MEMORY_MB"": 4096,
     ""DISK_GB"": 100,
     ""NUMA_SOCKETS"": 1,
     ""NUMA_CORES"": 4,
     ""NUMA_THREADS"": 4,
     ""PCI_SRIOV_VF"": 1
   }

When the capabilities stuff gets similarly cleaned up (Newton or Ocata), we would be able to add a similar structure for the qualitative parts of the instance launch request:

 {
   ""capabilities"": {
     ""cpu"": {
       ""required"": [
         ""sse"",
         ""mmx""
       ],
       ""preferred"": [
         ""avx2""
       ]
     }
     ""disk"": {
       ""type"": ""ssd""
     }
   }
 }

of course, the above is totally just a straw-man but it shows a way to completely remove the entire concept of the flavor from the REST API once the instance is launched. The concept of a flavor (preferably renamed to ""instance template"" or something like that) could exist in a different REST API layer that would be decomposed into its requisite resources and capabilities parts upon the call to launch the instance.",False,21

Either we break our API and remove that (or change the format of the thing we point to) or we implement this very simple change to expose the flavor information that we currently have on the instance so we can move forward.

IMHO, this does not further codify anything that we don't already have codified today, it just makes it less of a lie and unblocks the cellsv2 work. When we get to the point of potentially removing the requirement for flavors from our API, we'll have a whole new set of decisions to make. That would be the time to think about how we're going to creatively break this (or not).

I'm really (really) not in favor of blocking cellsv2 on the assumption that we'll all be able to agree on capability and resource type stuff like you propose above.

Thanks for your review.

Actually using decorator was our first choice but as Cao explained the decorator will work with cases like get() but will not work for create() and update() for example.

The kwargs in update() and create() can only contain keys allowed by the schema. 'request_ids' and 'hook' do not belong to the image schema as a result we get schema validation

We can work around this problem by first popping off 'request_ids' and 'hook' from kwargs to local variables before creating model object but that will only complicate things rather than simplifying.",False,21

This is my concern
1.This decorator doesn't work for the update() function in line 284.
The update() function calls get() function in line 293 but the 'request_ids' is poped by warpped_fn().
2.This decorator solution also needs a lot of change in code.
3.If we add this decorator only for get() function, such difference will make user confused.

I just checked on the link you referred and corrected the flavor input from a list to a single value only. The command now works fine for flavor as a positional parameter (nova boot --image 1f4c2e62-bdb6-4b9b-9bb8-b6bb0ae966dc 1 test2) but stills fails for the --flavor option as I have not found a way to change the action to the Deprecated one. 

The code now looks like this :

@cliutils.arg(
    'flavor',
    metavar='<flavor>',
    default=argparse.SUPPRESS,
    help=_(""Name or ID of flavor (see 'nova flavor-list').""))
@cliutils.arg(
    '--flavor',

Also for the test cases, I will surely add some new test cases that care of all the scenarios.

Although I'm also unsure if it is a good idea or a bad idea in the long run.  The reason I raised the instance_info field  question is because the field is wiped when the node is unprovisioned, so I guess it would really come down to what the use case is and what makes the most sense in that use case, because I could see both being extremely useful.  If memory serves, we presently assert everything applied through to instance_info upon the deploy process, so at present I guess we would loose it.  Honestly, I could see both places being useful depending on the use case.  Thoughts on at some point possibly bifrost potentially putting the ipv4 address in the instance info anyway at a later point in time?

Sure - the idea is that we should never really set MTU to zero. Ever. It doesn't make sense. So I'm changing Neutron to have it default to 1500 bytes for the MTU. Therefore we should never get an mtu of 0 back from Neutron, once that patch merges.",False,21

Instead, why not request_quota for an object with a specific uuid, and have a single request that says what resources need to be claimed. Then you get a yes or no answer on if that claim for that compound set of resources is possibly or not.

If you delete that resources, you release the quota for that uuid.

i.e. the create instance fails, you still consume quota till the instance is deleted. That seems a fair trade for much less complexity.

This is possible because you request all the required resources for a single user API call in one bundle. So you don't need to build up a large number of reservations, then commit them once you have them all.

This is not accurate. AFAIC this will be put to in_use only if we have succeeded in attaching the volume already (since Ciner looks for ""attach_status"" to be ""attaching"".

This is exactly what we want to happen and why we call reserve_volume. Check_attach is wrong but it does check for AZs which don't change that often so it's still a useful check to have.

> But when we call unreserve_volume, that will also fail if the state is not 'attaching'. this could happen if the call we've competed with finishes (state is now in-use) or if a multi-attach detaching was or still is in progress (state is detaching or available).

The reason I raise this is that if we extend the lifecycle of every release to say, 5 years, then at some point you are going to have a *lot* of concurrent streams to be managing with associated load on developers, ci, etc. Life-cycle for our commercial distro is currently ""only"" 3 years, but at the end of 2016 that is already expected to be 5-6 concurrent streams.

As such I'd also question whether it is wise to try and go straight to 3-5 years versus initially start trying to increment up from the current baseline (say try to move the needle from 13 months to 18 months, measure the impacts resource wise, then adjust and repeat as necessary).",False,21

> Up until the Liberty release, the python package versions were bounded on the lower side, but not the upper side, which meant that even though the release branch would pull the same version of the OpenStack code, the infra installation of test clouds would pull the latest versions of python packages that were specified in the requirements.  This caused the OpenStack Release, with fixed code, to quickly break when the external packages changed in incompatible ways. Trying to keep the test framework and stable branch working with the latest python packages is likely the biggest reason for early EOL of the stable releases.

Question for you though - when you're setting context do you really care about which API version it's using? I suspect in most if not all cases you just want the dependency set up and you don't care how. What you care about is the scenario's details.

In my testing I can make it switch versions that things like the User context uses by using a different deployment URL, despite what api_versions says on the scenario task configs.

Also one more thing, I think it's probably a bit ambitious to try and make all the APIs look the same via a wrapper. You can get away with it in some instances, but as you have found there are some underlying problems like the different Role etc objects which needed the namedtuple hack. There are also other instances where the API may clash and you need to choose one or the other because of different arg requirements.

I actually think it's a better solution to make each context object handle its own API versioning requirements. We can refactor stuff between scenario/context/etc as required as and when it comes up. That way, there's no wrangling of fake objects needed and the code becomes much simpler, especially in the case where the same op in different APIs has different arg requirements.  It's not like new APIs get added all the time either.

I would like to see the spec you have if you can link it please?",False,21

Last week we discussed with Boris P (boris-42) the future of wrappers. He wants to update(actually rewrite) a spec in near future, but he don't have enough time for it now. :(

The main idea(btw, it was discussed based on keystone wrapper) looks like:

    class KeystoneService(BaseServiceClass):
        def __init__(version):
             self.impl = KeystoneV2() if version == 2 else KeystoneV3()
       
       def create_project():
            result = self.impl.create_project()
            # handle the difference between result of different APIs
            return result


KeystoneService class will include only methods, which are exist in both APIs and handle the difference between input args and output result. It will be used in Context, Validation, not-keystone scenarios and etc. In other words, it will be used in all places where we don't want to care about api version and expect that it will work for every supported version. For example, if I setup VolumeGenerator(cinder context), I expect that it will work for both V1 and V2. But even if we don't want to care about api versions in context, sometimes we still need it. For example, endpoints of each service can be discovered via service catalog by service_type. In case of using Cinder V2 in context, we need to specify volumev2 service_type via api_versions context and ""2"" version. This applies to all non-default service types and versions.

KeystoneV2 and KeystoneV3 classes will implement the full APIs for each version without compatibility with another version. These classes will be used in those places, where we need to check the right feature for right version.

Now, we are at the point, when refactoring of wrappers, scenario utils is a high priority thing and it would be nice to do not write hacks in different places, so it would be easier to switch to new entity ""Service"".",False,21

Your answer is like this:
""Suppose there is bridge in upstream router, which has VXLAN interfaces. For example, vif1 is VXLAN tunnel to Node1, and vif2 is VXLAN tunnel to Node2.
When upstream want to send packet to VM1, it will flood the ARP request to both interface vif1 and vif2, then it will learn VM1 on vif1. Then IP1/MAC1 associated to Node1 is learnt.

For migration. It includes 2 aspects:
1. How DVR router on Node1 delete the FIP namespace, and DVR router on Node2 add the FIP namespace. DVR feature already implemented this part. 
2. How upstream router will be aware of the migration? It depends mac learning. If there is data packet from VM1, the bridge will learm IP/MAC1 on new interface.""

But my comment in last patch could be explained in more detail:

Suppose that there are two external VxLAN networks, VxLAN1, and VxLAN2, There are 20 VMs, 10 of them( VM1,...VN10) has floating IP address from VxLAN1, and VM1 in Node1, VM2 in Node2, ... VM10 in Node 10, the other 10 VMs has floating IP from VxLAN2, and VM11 in Node 11, ..., VM20 in Node 20.

The upstream router has two vif, vif1 for VxLAN1, vif2 for VxLAN2. When upstream router flood ARP request for the FIP1 of VM1, will the ARP request be flood to Node1~Node10, or the ARP request will be flood to Node1~Node20. As FIP1 is one IP address in VxLAN1, it should not be flood to Node11~Node 20, no FIP from VxLAN2 located in Node11~Node20.  If so, how upstream router understand that ARP request for FIP1 should be only flood to Node1~Node10?

If you have assumption that the ARP will be flood to all compute nodes, then how to narrow down the ARP traffic.",False,21

In this example, there are 2 VXLAN networks, there should have 2 bridges. So ARP for FIP1 should only flood to VXLAN1 network.

Suppose the upstream router(R) is VM with ovs. R will have 20 vxlan tunnel interfaces(vif1 ... vif20) to Node1 ... Node20. Vif1 ... vif10 will be put in a vlan1, where other tunnels will be put in vlan2.

If upstream is hardware switch like Arista, it's similar, each VXLAN network map to a VLAN. ARP are only flood in its vlan domain.

Of course, use dynamic arp to learn the upstream router MAC may cause too much broadcast when DVR is enabled.

3. Update ""--provider:underlay_flooding_list"" is error-prone. For example, delete an IP address from the list, OVS Agent/Linux bridge Agent need capture this event to delete tunnel. Maybe other feature also need capture this event.

1. Mapping VNI to a IP multicast group. This is supported (but not required) by the ML2 LinuxBridge implementation, but is not currently supported by OVS.

2. Keep a list of underlay IP addresses associated with each network, and flood BUM traffic for that network to that list of VXLAN tunnels.

Also the name makes sense because they are the correct kwargs that are being passed to the managers get(). I think the name makes sense to me.  Do you have any suggestions? 


You don't realize this is working incorrectly because everything is caught in the excepts, but each managers get() is different.  for example lets take keystone


openstack user show user_id --domain domain_id

- this will not work since in the **kwargs the domain_id is specified, but in keystoneclient's UserManager.get(user_id) [0] there is no where to accept the kwargs.  Which means there are to many arguments passed to the getter and a TypeError occurs. 


openstack project show project_id --domain_id


- but if we look at the manager get() it takes specific kwargs.. but not the domain_id so when this is called the domain_id is passed into with the kwargs which will cause a TypeError when it gets to the .get() since it is not expecting the domain_id to be passed, but is expecting many other keyword arguments.

However it is problematic to apply the same logic to live migration, because LM always needs the same set of resources to migrate a VM.

Hi, Michal, I'm not very sure about the idea. If we use a consistent hash ring to choose the scheduler, someone will be  responsible for the choosing. If we don't want c-sch to do that, then we need another service. If we use c-sch, then we may face race condition to access the ring. Also we need someplace in other name space which is not in c-sch. I think it's a bit complicated, as we just want to send some notifications to the ceilometer service as possible as less.

3. c-sch D proceeds with 'notify' message from B before finishing processing 'update' from A.

In my mind this means that for a user of the cloud they would have control over failovers and that sort of thing. The main use-case I remember that was brought up was that the user (in this case the application admin) would potentially want to be able to failover volumes for test purposes without needing an openstack admin to do it, or affecting volumes from other tenants. This kind of ties into the cg's nicely since it would make sense that some app using a cg would want to failover the whole cg in a consistent way.

To Simon's point an app admin (openstack user) would have control, and maybe more importantly for compliance or SLA kind of stuff on an app by app basis. They could have much more knowledge about how volumes are replicated and whether or not they can failover the app (by actually testing it). This spec doesn't really have any additional granularity around the where, when, and how of replication as mentioned by Simon, but I do however think it becomes a natural extension of this to allow for user specified parameters like that (beyond the ability to pick from different volumes types where an admin set them up beforehand like we have today).

I think there would be no problem if a bare metal server supported only traditional NIC which only support untag ethernet packet.
But I believe that it would not so simple in case that NIC supported PCI virtual function such as Emulex CNA card.
In order to create NIC and iSCSI on one physical ethernet port of the NIC, the physical siwtch port has to be trunk mode.
But PXE client fw code in NIC doesn't understand VLAN, but PXE client code in UEFI understand VLAN.
It's really complected situation.

Thanks for the review!

One example I can think of is like this:

Assume a bare metal server has 4 NICs.
2 NICs are used to boot OS via iSCSI from Cinder volume for multipath or teaming, and the other 2 NICs are used tenant network for bonding or teaming, then somehow the OS turned not to respond.

In order to investigate if this problem is either iscsi path or tenant network path by booting rescue image from rescue network, this is impossible. Because there are only 4 NICs.
There is no NIC to be assigned to rescue network.

Did I answer your question?

Naohiro.",False,21

1) I think validate() should not only for parameters validation now, as we can allocate ports without the port parameter set, so in addition of parameters validation, the validate() method need to check whether there's port available for allocation, and preserve the port in case of allocated by others while starting console, so I add a return to it.

A compute node is just one of many classes of resource. The idea is that the state of these resources will (eventually) be managed globally with clear requirements and methods for keeping the state up to date. I think this is a good medium to long term solution as there's a relatively clear migration path from where we are now.

For a really long term solution, though, I don't think it can scale to the kinds of volumes that we can speculate about in the not to distant future. In that future I think scheduling needs to become more event and message driven and individual resources need to be able to accept events from a global event pool. Instead of reasource tracking we just make sure there's a superabundance of resources and request specs (constraints) can be declared to be hard (must have) or soft (please try but we'll cope) and then the event can be tuned to express how many times it is willing to be retried before it will allow failures in soft constraints to equal success.
