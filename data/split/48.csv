I would agree with yoctozepto, we can't add more options to kolla-ansible just to be able to run with old images. I suppose we would advise using kolla images built around the same time as the kolla-ansible code being used to deploy them.

DD.MM.YYYY - Kolla released image with code where this option was false (unfortunatelly we have it)

Not everyone is upgrading working openstack (images) every week. And if this option is true by default and *it is* true even if it is not in configuration. Why to not set up ? Option in your backend snippets will override default one.

This is not changing anything ..this only adds option to configure if anybody wants.

This is not same as cluster = XYZ in cinder.conf ..because user need to migrate somehow in that case - because it is not compatible change.

This option can user change as he wants based on value in /etc/kolla/globals AND can override on another layer - in configuration overrided in /etc/kolla/config/cinder/...*

From user pov it is not working as the other modules, because it only adds or deletes metadata what one passes to the module. Other modules try hard to set resources to the state that the user requested, so in this case one would expect that after calling the module the server metadata would match *exactly* the content one passed to the module.

We should definitely document this non-obvious behaviour in the docs.

```
Make driver package release a command line param

Instead of hard-coding driver versions in the initramfs init script,
this commit makes the driver package release (e.g., ""cvl-2.54"") a kernel
command line parameter. As an example, if a driver package release is
specified with the command line argument multi-drivers-switch=<release>,
then the initramfs init script will look for the drivers in
""/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/{ice,iavf,i40e}-<release>/"". This way, the
initramfs will not need further modifications for new/different driver
package releases that are integrated into StarlingX in the future.

The initramfs file is rather large and will appear to change frequently.  This will expand the size of a patch in Debian for no good reason as the original initramfs can generally be reused.  To solve this bloat problem, we introduce a new empty package called initramfs-trigger.  The job of this package is to indicate to the Debian patch build system whether or not to include the new initramfs.  If this empty package has a version change, then the Debian patch build system will include the new initramfs, otherwise the old initramfs will still be used and not included in the patch.",True,48

i.e. it's a bit of a legacy value.  It used to refer to where the packages came from.  'distro' meant ""the distro package archives"". 'cloud:focal-yoga' indicated the cloud archive, and there are various other possible values too.

So 'distro' is not more special that 'cloud:focal-xena' or 'xena'.

* <openstack-codename>: e.g. ussuri.  This is the universal (and now preferred) way of referring to release, and has the advantage of being 'ussuri' on focal (rather than 'distro') and also 'ussuri' on bionic, instead of 'cloud:bionic-ussuri'.

I agree with both of you and the intention is not to reduce the development cycle for oslo/lib instead we want to avoid any breaking changes happening at the end of the cycle and the project getting broken.

The idea here is (what Elod mentioned) to provide a soft freeze date (not final) so that anyone pushing oslo changes after that deadline can be more careful about any breaking change. And getting FFE for any big change (oslo team can decide that this might be an incompatible change so let's go for FFE) so that we at a broader level know that this change is coming. Also, another benefit will be early releases of oslo/lib ( at the soft freeze, FFE) so that the new release version is used as constraints in gate and the project will get to know the breaking change early.

If you think *feature freeze* naming is a little strong statement here then we can use some other wording something like 'backward incompatible change freeze' or any better word. idea is to notice/carefully test the incompatible changes coming/releasing after this deadline.

Please let us know if that works for you. or feel free to propose any other idea to avoid having incomaptible changes released at the close of final release.",False,48

My takeaway from the TC discussion was that oslo-consuming projects would like a warning that something big is coming.  But as Stephen pointed out, there have been announcements about SQLAlchemy 2.0 for a long time, so no one should have been surprised that something could break wiht the oslo.db release.  The idea of the library feature freeze is that possibly breaking stuff that's under development would be announced on the ML to get a FFE, and that would alert all oslo-consuming projects.  On the other hand, it could just be yet another email that no one pays attention to, and extra overhead for an already strapped oslo team.

In the context of hosting a RAN Application on StarlingX, the O-RAN O2 Application provides and exposes the IMS and DMS service APIs of the O2 interface between the O-Cloud (StarlingX) and the Service Management & Orchestration (SMO), in the O-RAN Architecture.

The O2 interface enables the management of the O-Cloud (StarlingX) infrastructure and the deployment life cycle management of |O-RAN| cloudified NFs that run on O-Cloud (StarlingX).  See `O-RAN O2 General Aspects and Principles
<https://orandownloadsweb.azurewebsites.net/specifications>`__, and `INF O2
documentation <https://docs.o-ran-sc.org/projects/o-ran-sc-pti-o2/en/latest/>`__.

The O-RAN O2 application is integrated into StarlingX as a system application.  The |O-RAN| O2 application package is installed in |prod| during system
installation, but it is not applied by default.

System administrators can follow the procedures below to install and uninstall
the |O-RAN| O2 application.

To fix this behaviour probably we need just remove those lines. Anyway this fix covers the general case for legacy parameters.

Regarding the last question, the problem with the translation of parameter names directly when the user adds them in service-parameter could present a confusing situation because the user will add one parameter name and see another when running service-parameter-list . For example, if the user add ""admission_plugins"" is not so clear to link this name with ""enable-admission-plugins""",False,48

The defect that is being fixed applies when these new parameter names are are used, and the /opt/platform/puppet/22.12/hieradata/system.yaml contains the parameters with underscore names instead of the names with dashes that I had used.

I think this observation is relevant to Chris' question ""Why wouldn't we convert these as part of the platform upgrade then, so that we can drop the special handling for legacy parameters?""

I could rephrase the question as ""Why wouldn't we translate the old names when the user uses them, and store the new names in hieradata yaml, and also translate them during upgrade"".

I see two possible ways:

1) We introduce another port attribute: hint_status, a dict with keys for the hint aliases and the usual status values, like: BUILD/ACTIVE/ERROR. For example:

port[""hint_status""] = {""ovs-tx-steering"": ""ACTIVE""}

2) Or that we omit this (hint_status) attribute and don't give feedback on the API. Then the user would only know about the effect of a hint via ad hoc ways, like the cloud admin communicating/documenting, which hints make sense in a particular deployment.

The spec currently proposes (2), but I'm also open to (1).",True,48

we have usually adhered to these deadlines and I believe it *is* forced because these transitions are openstack wide (i.e. https://releases.openstack.org/index.html dates here).

However it also doesn't cause any problems for tripleo. It just means we won't make any more upstream releases. We can continue to merge backports.

Note that train has been in EM for about a year now [1] and that is still an active branch for us. 

lets chat more on irc in a bit if you want? I think we'll want to make a final release for wallaby before it goes em so that patch will have to go before this one (i.e. release then tag em).

1) Because we don't use the ZKObject load/save methods, we are missing out on a lot of important work that it does for us:

  * read/write stats
  * retry attempts if there is a network issue
  * verification that the lock is still held

I think the last two are critical.  There are some places where we read data without the help of ZKObject, but we don't write data without it.

2) We leave this object in an invalid state: we leave self.old_queues as a list of strings where it should be a list of objects.  That's technically fine because we don't do anything with this object after this without performing a refresh() first which should take care of returning those to objects.  However, it seems potentially dangerous to leave it this way.

I don't think we want to actually put objects there (because to do so correctly, we might need to deserialize them if there's a new one we don't already have).  Instead, I propose that we leave the lists empty, and then leave lots of comments/notes reminding ourselves that's what we're doing.  It actually means that the output of the _postConfig method in the manager is the same regardless: at the end of that method, we have a PipelineState object with zero ChangeQueue objects attached to it, no matter what happens in the method.

I will push up a patchset that implements my suggestions (mostly because I had to write it anyway to fully explore the ideas).",False,48

Now going forward I assume we'll eventually want to move to opae-sdk-2.1.0, and for that they have stopped providing binary RPMs upstream, so at that point it'll make sense to build our own Docker image using whatever base image makes sense.

The Debian fm-rest-api container behavior is still under testing. The reason why I uploaded this review is because I'm working on porting fm-rest-api container to Debian (https://review.opendev.org/c/starlingx/fault/+/862501), and when I wanted to build it, the build failed due to missing dependencies on cgts-client wheel.
I've added cgts-client-wheel on the .inc field and re-build the package. That way, the image can be build correctly.

Possibly is not the only wheel that need to be added on Debian:

I don't have a k8s instance handy, so Docker can act as a stand-in for example:

So here we see 'docker logs' working as expected.

So this change is not acceptable as it is since it breaks 'docker logs' and most likely 'kubectl logs' functionality.

Instead of modifying the nginx.conf to use a different path for error_log and access_log create the new directory as a soft-link to /var/log/nginx. This should allow logs to be extracted as you outline in this change, while not breaking things that need to continue to work.",True,48

I think we should split these. So, the canonical inventory will be kept in ""inventory"", while anything generated or modified by plugins will be kept in another field ""plugin_data"".

The reasons are twofold. First, consumers who are only interested in the inventory will be able to filter only it using e.g. ?fields=inventory. Second, we'll provide a clear difference between something generated according to the documented schema and something that can different depending on the exact set of plugins.

The definition of ""expose_ipv6_gua_tenant_networks"" at config.py states: ""Expose only VM IPv6 IPs on tenant networks if they are GUA"". Therefore, what the code does at the moment is expose all the tenant networks if ""expose_tenant_networks"" is enabled. But once ""expose_ipv6_gua_tenant_networks"" is enabled, only IPv6 GUA IPs are exposed, regardless of the ""expose_tenant_networks"".
Therefore they are mutually exclusive. Either you want to expose all, or only the IPv6 ranges.

That said... if this is not the preferred way, I can change the code so that either:
- We make it the other way around, you can set ""expose_ipv6_gua_tenant_networks"" for only exposing IPv6, but if you also set ""expose_tenant_networks"" it does not matter the value of ""expose_ipv6_gua_tenant_networks"", everything will be exposed
- Modify the expose_tenant_networks option so that it is not a boolean anymore, but a string: None|ipv6gua|all

We should only need to fix this for queens+. Also, this merge request is missing the wallaby/nova.conf update.

Worth noting, each branch of this repository supports 2 openstack releases (N and N-1). The mapping is:
master == yoga and zed (eventually this will be zed and antelope)
stable/zed == yoga and zed
stable/yoga == xena and yoga
stable/xena == wallaby and xena
stable/wallaby == victoria and wallaby
stable/victoria == ussuri and victoria
stable/ussuri == train and ussuri

So.. tl;dr this change should be backported to all of those branches for a complete fix. Seeing as though the templates directory in master has all of these directories, I think the approach that you are taking makes sense - ie. fixing older ""unsupported"" releases in the newer branches, since it makes backporting easier.

Note, there will be changes among the backports due to older branches not containing newer release directories.",False,48

There are a few reasons for this but the most pressing one is that it's a *huge* breaking change that will break multiple users' scripts. Consider a script that did this, for example.

  openstack volume create --snapshot my_snapshot 123

Previously this would have created a snapshot with name=123 and size=$my_snapshot.size. With this change, this will create a snapshot with size=123 and name=<random UUID>/null. Likewise, consider a command like this:

  openstack volume create --size 123 foo

This would now be an invalid command since '--size' is no longer a valid option and 'name' is no longer a valid positional argument.

Breaking changes aside, there's a bigger philosophical point here. You indicate that we expect there to be a smooth transition from cinderclient to openstackclient. This is an important goal, yes, but there is a far *more* important goal: namely, uniformity between OSC commands. This is explicitly called out in the summary from the README:

  OpenStackClient (aka OSC) is a command-line client for OpenStack that brings the
  command set for Compute, Identity, Image, Network, Object Store and Block Storage
  APIs together in a single shell **with a uniform command structure**.

(emphasis mine).

While we should not go out of our way to introduce unnecessary friction, this is a great example of where consistency between OSC commands must trump consistency with the legacy client. OSC 'resource create' commands have a pattern of providing an name or identifier as their positional argument. This change would break this pattern and mean that 'volume create' behaves totally different from commands like 'server create', 'network create', 'image create', 'project create', 'user create', 'flavor create', etc. (and that's not even thinking about out-of-tree OSC plugins like osc-placement or python-manilaclient...). We can't and won't do this. For what it's worth, other examples of differences exist such as how OSC handles boolean values compared to the legacy clients (--flag/--no-flag vs. --flag=<true|false>), its use of the '<resource> set' and 'resource unset' command to make changes to an existing resource rather than a plethora of 'resource <action>' commands, which only exist where they make sense (I can go into this in more detail if you'd like).

I understand that you care about your users and would like them to be able to migrate to OSC as easily as possible. To make this easier, I would suggest looking at ways to fix _cinderclient_ so that the OSC-style of pattern is possible. Alternatively, document the heck out of this. Nova migrated all of its in-tree documentation to use OSC some time ago and to the best of my knowledge, most of Red Hat's downstream docs have also been updated now (I can't speak for other vendors). Before this happened though, we gave examples of OSC usage _alongside_ novaclient usage and this was helpful to compare the two. Either of these options would help your users without diminishing one of the biggest value-adds of OSC: its uniformity.

Hope that all makes sense. I'm happy to discuss this in greater detail if you wish.",False,48

Yes and that was a bad thing since it turns out there are quite a few deployments running older cinder versions 😄 Talk to gtema if you want to know more. Long story short, we're now working to migrate all cinder-related commands from cinderclient to SDK since that continues to support v2.

I agree, but like cinder and mostly everyone else, we don't break stuff like this. Since this is breaking change, you need at least 6 months or 1 release worth of a deprecation cycle, no different to most other OpenStack projects. This is all a moot discussion given my consistency comments below.

This is kind of my point, the APIs of each service behaves differently and unless you're an OpenStack power user/contributor, this discrepancy will annoying at best and downright confusing at worst. OSC's primary goal is to hide or smooth over these differences where it makes sense and as such we enforce the pattern of 'resource create <human-readable identifer>' I mentioned in my email.

This being said, we actually have made an exception for cinder, in that '<human-readable identifer>' is now optional. tbh, I've no idea why this isn't good enough. Not insisting on something the API doesn't need is a fair argument but consistency with the legacy client isn't, especially when it conflicts with OSC's own goals. It's not like users can simply replace 'cinder create' with 'openstack volume create' and expect everything to work, right? We have different name for most other options ('--backup' vs. '--backup-id', '--property' vs '--metadata', etc.). Why is a user capable of changing '--backup-id <backup>' to '--backup-id <backup>' yet they can't change '--name <name> <size>' to '--size <size> <name>'?

OSC 'resource create' commands have a pattern of providing an name or identifier as their positional argument. This change would break this pattern and mean that 'volume create' behaves totally different from commands like 'server create', 'network create', 'image create', 'project create', 'user create', 'flavor create', etc. (and that's not even thinking about out-of-tree OSC plugins like osc-placement or python-manilaclient...). We can't and won't do this.

It may be more important, but that doesn't mean it has to be a positional argument. Cinder isn't unique here. Consider compute flavors. A flavor's RAM, CPU and disk properties are every bit as important as the name (you can't create a flavor without any of these), yet only '<name>' is a positional argument in OSC and the rest are required options. This allows us to be consistent with the other 'resource create' commands. It's also a lot nicer to use. These commands do the same thing. Which is more obvious?

  nova flavor-create foo 1000 4 2 1
  openstack flavor create --id 1000 --ram 4 --disk 2 --vcpus 1 foo

> but we can't change the past now and due to the nature of our projects being backward compatible, that is another hurdle to make this change not possible.

This backwards compatibility also applies to OSC, as noted above.

There are a few reasons for this but the most pressing one is that it's a *huge* breaking change that will break multiple users' scripts. 

I understand the concern but doesn't any major change causes this issue? We recently removed cinder V2 so any script doing API requests to it will fail and they need to update it.

I highly doubt someone in a production environment would be running a script setting names as numbers.
For others, that are using good identifiers as names, they will surely contain alpha characters and will fail here so they will know it's time to update the script.
In any case, we won't end up creating volumes with a crazy amount of size.

Yes, and that is the purpose of this change. since their scripts will fail, they can update it. They won't end up in a case where this will succeed in a weird way that is undetectable and will cause issues later.

I'm in favor of consistency but at the same time, we are comparing cinder to other projects who followed similar structure to OSC in their project specific clients. If we take a look at the project specific clients,

1) Nova: it was always mandatory to provide a name in ``nova boot`` command so they don't see any change
2) Glance: glance has no parameter as mandatory in glance client so they also don't seem to bother if name becomes positional.
3) Keystone: keystone client also had the requirement to pass name argument
keystone tenant-create --name <tenant-name>

For cinder's case (and other cinder cores can agree/disagree with me), size is far more important than name and should have been in that order since the beginning but we can't change the past now and due to the nature of our projects being backward compatible, that is another hurdle to make this change not possible.

I was able to do a bit of debugging during the weekend. Here's what I've found so far:

1) When the migration fails, the test fails waiting for the sub-port to become active after the migration: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tempest/+/865041/2/tempest/api/compute/admin/test_live_migration.py#287

2) Given this, I wanted to check what a successful case does. I put together the sequence of events for the sub-port in a good case here: https://paste.openstack.org/show/b2lJAAgD33q65JRCQHEt/

A recording of the meeting is fully transparent, IMHO, and if understanding the speech is a problem, I would welcome someone like you volunteering to provide a high quality transcript of the video after it's posted.

Inclusivity is obviously something we need to aim for. However, it need not be absolute. If we *only* did video meetings, then the bar for participation would be ""can attend and be effective in a video meeting."" However, we don't, and as such, if someone wants to bring something to the attention of the TC, they can certainly do that in 75% of the other meetings. I think it would also be more than okay for someone to ask that a topic be covered (or re-covered) in a text meeting if that works better for them.

We have quorum rules for meetings because not everyone can make every meeting. We don't *not* have the meeting because some people can't join. We also don't *not* have the meeting because someone in an opposed timezone can't make it. We have PTGs, summits, and in-person TC meetings even though not everyone can/will travel, and in rooms that can't possibly contain the whole community. We do this even though they're not fully inclusive, because there's a tradeoff between absolute inclusivity and productivity, and that tradeoff need not be considered to be *excluding* people that can't be there.

I think a balance of video and text offers more than enough opportunity for people to participate in the way that works best for them.

So, about the sql queries:
All the tree query.outerjoin in this file does not apply to the OVN case. This outerjoin would serve to confirm that the l3.db.router.id is the same as the extra attribute table, and then filter the outer_attrs.distributed attribute.
In the case of previously set parameters (proposed fix), the filters by ""l3_db.Router.id == router_attrs.router_id and
router_attrs.distributed != sa.sql.true()"" will not change the original query because they will no longer consult in the router_extra_attributes table, but in the l3_db.Router table itself.

Is it correct or did I miss something?

Thank you for your question.

We don't have an exception list if someone is not an active contributor. Let me describe the community's process below to see if that might help with what you are asking about.

We have a set of criteria set for the StarlingX elections in terms of who can run for positions. As part of that, for every role that we fill through an election, the candidates need to be active contributors to the StarlingX open source project. You can find more information about this on the election website: https://docs.starlingx.io/election/#project-leads-and-technical-leads-election

We identify code and documentation contributors through an automated process by extracting information from the git repos of the project. To capture people who are actively participating in the community, but don't have a contribution to any of the git repos, we maintain a list for every project team in the projects.yaml file here: https://opendev.org/starlingx/governance/src/branch/master/reference/tsc/projects.yaml

If Mike is not yet a contributor to the StarlingX project, he can start participating now and can run again in the next election, or in an intermittent election, if there will be one including this position.

Does this help?

The 'extra-atcs' field is the list I described in my previous comment:
""We identify code and documentation contributors through an automated process by extracting information from the git repos of the project. To capture people who are actively participating in the community, but don't have a contribution to any of the git repos, we maintain a list for every project team in the projects.yaml file here: https://opendev.org/starlingx/governance/src/branch/master/reference/tsc/projects.yaml""

The nomination period for the current election is now closed with this position remaining unfilled. The election officials will bring this to the attention of the community and TSC to find a solution. One option could be to fill this position through an intermittent election process later. Every candidate who is running for the position needs to be an active contributor to the StarlingX project and Individual Member of the OpenInfra Foundation.

When it comes to defining who is a contributor, this documentation comes the closest to it: https://docs.starlingx.io/governance/reference/tsc/stx_charter.html#contributors

We do not have an exact list of activities with regards to defining contributions, since it can be vary by a few factors what a person can do at any given time to participate in and support the community and its mission. The person's activities and contributions however, should be publicly visible in the open source community and/or its artifacts.

Sometimes these differences were drastic; eliminating entire sections of the meeting in order to make the proceedings seem more orderly.

My desire to have someone separated from the debate be assigned to take these were twofold:
- As a TC member, I'd find it difficult to both participate in the meeting and create clear, detailed notes.
- Given my history in journalism, I know that it can be difficult to write impartial complete notes; especially when those notes might expose discord between members.

This is also the primary reason why your summaries to the list, while excellent and accurate, do not IMO take the place of a high quality transcript.

All official patches are built in a single persistent build environment.

Every kernel patch always rebuilds and ships all the kernel modules as well.

A kernel module patch can be built independently of the kernel due to the persistent build environment.

The CentOS Build avoidance feature allowed a designer to avoid kernel rebuilds when developing a module patch in his own dev environment.  I assume the Debian builds --reuse feature can be used the same way, but perhaps we ned to test that.

Before the k8s custom configuration feature was introduced, only two parameters could be set at runtime: oidc parameters and admission plugins. For both parameter there were validations and the tags used in hieradata were hardcoded.

After the new feature, all validations were relaxed and the user can now enter any parameter without validation. Also, all the tags for hieradata are generated dinamically with the following format: platform::kubernetes::<section_name>::params::<parameter_name>

The two special cases are still admission plugins and oidc. For them, we support both legacy and new formats, and maintain ad-hoc validations. The problem originated when the validation functions were updated, the legacy parameter names were replaced in that functions but the legacy ad-hoc labels were kept, which are no longer necessary considering that the labels are now generated dynamically.

The current behavior means that if a user enters the oidc parameters with the new k8s expected format, the label that is included in hieradata is the legacy one. However, this does not raise an error during service-parameter-apply process because the legacy tags are still valid, which is the case if the user directly enters the same parameters with the legacy names.",False,48

In this sense I would want there to be future story about removing the deprecated values which would include an upgrade script to replace them.  We should also be including a release notice about the deprecation in advance of removing them.

I can fix it after the parent merges--until then it's impossible. It was just taking long enough to merge that I wanted to work on doing the backports in parallel.

TBH I don't like that behavior of gerrit but it is how it behaves. In case you are submitting early backport then you can add the hash manually or use cli instead of web interface.
 
> Quick question: Do we have some documentation somewhere on the proper usage of ""cherry picked from"" with OpenStack projects? I've never heard of a project wanting multiple ""cherry picked from"" lines, since you can't cherry pick from multiple commits. The git cherry-pick -x documentation even mentions not using it at all if it isn't a clean change. I checked [1], [2], and [3] and didn't see anyhing (though [3] mentions using cherry-pick -x to avoid a gerrit bug that was resolved in 2016).

I'm not aware of any official document and I think the policy depends on each project. But the intention to add the commit hash is to allow tracking all backports back to that stable branch.

> I'm just trying to figure out if this is an OpenStack-wide suggested behavior, or something more common on the deployment tool projects, etc.

As far as I've worked in multiple projects such as Nova, Cinder, Neutron and etc,  this is community-wide recommendation.

That's correct, I think is desired to have a static tag and re-tag/update the references as the docker image is updated (cc Davlet for more clarification).

The image is still being built daily under the ""master-debian-stable-latest"" tag.

[2022-11-06T16:54:11.803Z] The push refers to repository [docker.io/starlingx/stx-fm-rest-api]


And also here [1] there is a public image tagged with ""master-debian-stable-latest"".

So I'm a bit confused about this new ""static"" tag, since it is related to a release (i.e. stx.8.0) shouldn't it be the tag only for that release?
On main branch, shouldn't we keep the ""master-debian-stable-latest"" to always point to the most recent image built?

Without this change, we get this error:

overcloud.ContrailControlOnlyServiceChain:

    resources.ContrailControlOnlyServiceChain: Error in 4 output role_data: Incorrect arguments: Items to merge must be maps.

With this change, the error would tell us what was incorrect and what type it was. For example, just running it with an example gives me:
```
Incorrect arguments: Items to merge must be maps. ['f1', 'b2'] is type <class 'list'> instead of a dict
```

This is helpful, because I can see the values that are causing the errors. Had the initial error printed the list that was causing the problem. It would be been much easier to grep for a string from that list in the templates directory and identify the issue.

So imo, this change will be helpful for that reason.

So, our options are limited. We could attempt to force an NTP sync early in the post-miniboot boot (when booting into ostree), but that would be more complicated than the simpler alternative of using the instdate value as employed here.

Two more considerations in favour of this simple fix:
1) This is a day-one problem that hasn't affected many installations. In most cases the hwclock should be set correctly in the BIOS as part of hardware setup.
2) Upon successful install/bootstrap/deployment, the regular NTP configuration brings the subcloud into full NTP sync, including adjusting the hwclock as necessary.  It all works itself out - we just need the time to be in the ballpark so as to avoid SSL certificate validations issues.",False,48

So I guess it comes down to the 17 patches. I think we need to have an answer around these before we can properly direct if this review is the right approach.

About the 17 patches: I looked into that list, one by one, and apparently we are now able to drop 8 of those commits (already available on version 7.0.0-3 and listed on this commit message).
From the remaining 9 commits, 2 were merged into a single patch to the config file libvirtd.service.in. Unfortunately, the remaining 7 commits are src code changes that I could not find on 7.0.0-3, so I ported it and that probably answers your question about using pristine Debian packages.

Now I would definitely appreciate yours and other more experienced colleagues feedback about this change, specially for the src code patches. I will probably add Jim Somerville to help with this review, since the majority of the code added on those commits was added by him.

Special care should be taken when reviewing the patch 0004-STX-DPDK-parms-handling.patch, this one I had to slightly change the code since both macros VIR_ALLOC and VIR_STRDUP are no longer available.

If the feedback is positive and we proceed with this approach, I can latter reduce the number of patches by merging together changes to the same file and/or somehow related.

The job still failed.. Looking at the log, it seems that some of tests which creates a volume passed with no issue[1].
And the number of failures increased from 3[2] to 36, so I guess the failures happen randomly.

To check the number of failures, I'd like to recheck this again.

Thank you for review and comments !

- I added requested log to bug description.

- Also config diff with parameters important for fixed (private) network vs public is added

- According to both tests - looks like some issue exists with tuple, returned by create_test_server. Your proposed solution for (1) is working, but it should work without this fix, as we execute https://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/6fa213cc0fcab744b46109e5f07cb58b0df4a314/tempest/api/compute/servers/test_server_rescue_negative.py#L149

and already should have updated server status. So for now I think there is common issue with both tests (1), (2) that create_test_server doesn't return correct updated server (Possible hypothesis - it returns not tuple, but only body. And body is the old one without IP)

if we change execution to:

        server, servers = self.create_test_server(
            adminPass=self.password,
            wait_until=""SSHABLE"",

Thank you for submitting the Distcloud TL role nomination on behalf of Tee Ngo.

Tee meets the criteria of being a core reviewer to the project.

However, I recognized that his OpenInfra Foundation membership profile is listed as ""membership_type"":""Community"". This field needs to be ""membership_type"":""Foundation"", which means that Steven will need to log into his profile and change it from 'Community' to 'Individual' membership. As OpenInfra Foundation Individual Membership profile is a requirement to participate in the project's elections.

Also please ask Tee to '+1' this review to show that he is accepting this nomination and would like to run for the position.

Thanks,

864088,/PATCHSET_LEVEL,7847,8,53961dc2_cd20817e,File,-1,,2022-11-17 11:22:14,"I reminded myself how the transient overlaps can occur (by reading test.probe.test_sharder.TestManagedContainerSharding.test_manage_shard_ranges_repair_parent_child_ranges):

* parent shards children, and updates root with deleted parent and active children - no overlap at root. BUT assume a root replica X fails to receive that update. The root replica still has the parent as being ACTIVE.

* children fetch their own shard range from root and update their state to ACTIVE.

* children get modified (object rows added/deleted) so have update stats to send to root, and at same time send their own shard range to root.

* root replica X does receive the update from the child, but has still not received an update from the deleted parent or replicated with peers, so it now has a stale copy of the ACTIVE parent and a copy of the ACTIVE child -> overlap.

* the transient overlap is automatically corrected once the replica X replicates with peers and discovers that the parent is in fact SHARDED/deleted.

However, if the root replica X is offline for more than a reclaim age (or maybe it's 2 reclaim ages) then the other replicas will have purged their copies of the SHARDED parent and the replica X will never remove its overlapping state ACTIVE parent shard range.

So perhaps we should add a condition that parent/child overlaps are no longer ignored if the child timestamp is more than reclaim age in the past i.e. ""enough time has passed that this transient should have been corrected, so now we'll start warning"". I'm just feeling very cautious about us permanently masking out what would be quite a bad situation.

As Carlos mentioned the rbac tests use the new implementation of metadata actions of v2 client.
So I guess all you need is to replace 'share_id' argument by 'resource_id', for instance:

            'delete_metadata', expected_status=200, share_id=share['id'],
            key='key')

Change to:

        self.do_request(

Circling back to this - I think I was mistaken, let me expand:

This change is currently doing some overrides in the metadata methods (in the json client). The method previously sent the requests for shares metadata in a certain way. Our metadata APIs have been changing over the past few months, and this change is implementing new tests, modifying the way we do requests to reflect our APIs in a smart and reusable way for shares, snapshots and some future resources that can come to have metadata.

This change [1] introduced some tests in the past weeks. These RBAC tests also contain a set of metadata tests for shares, which are referring to the old way we used to send requests, making the RBAC tests to fail. In order to have the tests passing again, we will need to take some actions:

- Rebase this change

This will help to reproduce issues in a local environment and also helps with keeping the change up-to-date

- Modify the RBAC share metadata tests

The tests doing requests like this [2] should be modified to used the methods being re-written in the json v2 client.

I believe that should solve the issue :)

1) As Sean mentioned, don't leave ping comments, it's not a priority patch and even if it is, the right way is to discuss it in the cinder meeting/IRC rather than spamming the comments.

2) It's advised to do quality reviews on other authors changes so as to get reviews. If your reviews are not useful to others, they would also not feel the urge to review your changes so make sure you leave some useful feedback for others so they feel good reviewing your patch as well.

1) As Sean mentioned, don't leave ping comments, it's not a priority patch and even if it is, the right way is to discuss it in the cinder meeting/IRC rather than spamming the comments.

2) It's advised to do quality reviews on other authors changes so as to get reviews. If your reviews are not useful to others, they would also not feel the urge to review your changes so make sure you leave some useful feedback for others so they feel good reviewing your patch as well.

3) We lack review bandwidth so expect delays in reviews. Also the priority of reviews is based on the next milestone so keep track of that and try to request for reviews based on it.",False,48

However, I decided to minimize my changes to this script as much as possible given that it's known to work going back to train for puppet-deployed systems including DCN deployments.

If you look at the diff [1] from when I only imported the script from THT, then you'll see I didn't change the logic to ""Ensure the secret XML file exists"". I left that in tact though I wrapped it in a new conditional. I then made that same code handle another condition, where puppet is not used, without actually changing the code that works when puppet is used. I think this change is safer as it doesn't disturb something we might be overlooking that can only be found from more empirical testing.

I was able to use the tripleo_nova_libvirt and tripleo_nova_compute roles to configure multiple ceph keys. I needed the following small patch to tripleo_nova_compute:

  https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-ansible/+/860873

I used the multiple ceph cluster case documented here:

 https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/tripleo-docs/+/859142
 
Note the example tripleo_ceph_cluster_keys and tripleo_cinder_rbd_multi_config above. The tripleo_ceph_client role then put the keys in place and the tripleo_nova_libvirt role then did additional processing on these keys as set up by this patch.

My tripleo_cinder_rbd_multi_config structure in my inventory was then consumed by the facts targeting multiple rbd backends support:

https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ansible/blob/master/tripleo_ansible/roles/tripleo_nova_libvirt/tasks/configure.yml#L23

tripleo_cinder_rbd_multi_config was used to set tripleo_nova_libvirt_cinder_rbd_multi_config and then the following were created in this pattern:

  tripleo_nova_libvirt_cinder_rbd_multi_config 
  - begats tripleo_nova_libvirt_ceph_multiconfig_info
  - begats tripleo_nova_libvirt_ceph_multiconfig_keyrings
     - begats tripleo_nova_libvirt_ceph_multiconfig_permissions
     
I then saw the secret files created:

  [stack@centos standalone]$ ls -l /var/lib/config-data/ansible-generated/nova_libvirt/etc/nova
  total 208
  -rw-r--r--. 1 root root     179 Oct 10 13:49 ceph2-secret.xml

  -rw-r--r--. 1 root root     173 Oct  7 21:33 secret.xml
  [stack@centos standalone]$

and this command:

  sudo podman exec nova_virtsecretd virsh secret-list
  for UUID in $(sudo podman exec nova_virtsecretd virsh secret-list | grep ceph | awk {'print $1'}); do
    sudo podman exec nova_virtsecretd virsh secret-get-value $UUID
  done

had the following output:

The way this metadata is set currently [1] does not work and is simply ignored by k8s. It must be stored either as metadata.labels or metadata.annotations. So we need to add either of those anyway. Thus, I decided to go with labels as I think the values we set there (node_id, provider_name, pool_name) match the semantics of identifying attributes of a k8s object.

Looks like with this patch we are going to add ~20MB on log storage server for each job.

* If the URL is auth_callback, just show that page and stop
* If we require read-only access, redirect to idp

Being able to put the redirect before normal content handling means we can ensure that we avoid rendering anything if auth is required, which I think is a straightforward and safe way of handling it.  And we must not allow control to reach the idp redirect if we're at auth_callback (otherwise we get an infinite redirect loop).

So while I can't say at this point exactly what timing issue led me to decide that this change was the one where we should move the auth_callback handling outside of the router, I think we should now consider it in the context of the upcoming change where there is a much better reason for doing so.",False,48

Strictly, the coomon verb for both actions is 'cleaving'. But there is plenty of ambiguity in the code: originally the sharder only sharded, and cleaving was only a shrading primitive. But when we added shrinking support and realised that shrinking would re-use the sharder's cleaving primitives, then the confusion arose.

Both sharding and shrinking DBs 'shard' (or 'cleave') themselves into shards!

It looks like Debian does not set a default search order with a configuration file:

```
sysadmin@controller-0:~$ man depmod.d  | head -n12; ls /{etc,usr/lib,run}/depmod.d
DEPMOD.D(5) depmod.d DEPMOD.D(5)

NAME
       depmod.d - Configuration directory for depmod

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/depmod.d/*.conf

       /etc/depmod.d/*.conf

       /run/depmod.d/*.conf

ls: cannot access '/etc/depmod.d': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access '/usr/lib/depmod.d': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access '/run/depmod.d': No such file or directory
```

When there is no configuration file, only the ""updates"" directory appears to be prioritized by the source code, but I might be incorrect: https://sources.debian.org/src/kmod/28-1/tools/depmod.c/#L831

It would be safer to have a depmod.d configuration file in Debian-based StarlingX, like CentOS-based StarlingX has. Example:

```
controller-0:~$ cat /etc/depmod.d/dist.conf
#
# depmod.conf
#

# override default search ordering for kmod packaging
search updates extra built-in weak-updates
```

However, if you are confident that this commit will not have any issues without a configuration file, please go ahead.",True,48

I know this is just a single package. But in general, I would avoid using loop with any of the package related Ansible modules. Each item in the loop is a new invocation of the package install process. So `dnf install package_1; dnf install package_2; dnf install package_3`. This is fairly inefficient, we're better of putting the list of packages directly into the name field, like they do in the example:
```
- name: Install the latest version of Apache and MariaDB
  ansible.builtin.package:
    name:
      - httpd
      - mariadb-server
    state: latest

Unfortunately we cannot implement filtering by ID that easy: openstacksdk does not pass id as a query param (even though the Heat API does support it). Its search_stacks() function does accept any query args, so filtering would always be done on clientside. Using find_stack would require us to implement the clientside filtering on our (aoc) side. None of those solutions is good..

Thanks for the review, appreciated!

Since you have pointed this out, I've investigated the possibility of an environment running on mysql < 8.0.17 for Focal and Jammy. Here are some facts I've found:

The first commit on this repository dates back to 04/10/2019 [1].
MySQL 8.0.17 has been released on 22/07/2019 [2]. 
The charm only supports 20.04 (Focal) & 22.04 (Jammy).
The charm installs MySQL via apt ""mysql-server-8.0"" package.
""mysql-server-8.0"" package for Focal got the 8.0.17 update on 06/09/2019 [3].
""mysql-server-8.0"" package for Jammy starts from 8.0.20, so we're good there [4]. 


So, considering the facts above, there should be no environments running on < 8.0.17. If we still want to be on the safe side, I can change `--set-gtid-purged` to `OFF` instead of `COMMENTED`, but the drawback will be to lose the commented-out `SET @@GLOBAL.gtid_purged` value.

Thanks for your work on this; based on the PTG discussions, Lets move forward on this - a couple of points that we have discussed elsewhere that we need to note:

1) We must try and build an efficient database query that returns the sum of allocated_capacity_gb for a given host -- unsure if we can add an index for the ""host"" attribute so this query is infact efficient.

You'll note I had to change a test in this change. This is the only thing that should change. If there were users of this that were either relying on the brackets being present or were stripping these brackets in a non-robust way (i.e. things crash if the brackets aren't present), they would be broken by this. However, with the current state of things they're already going to be broken by Python 3.9.11 or 3.12.x onwards, so not a whole lot is changing here.

No, I couldn't find any via codesearch.o.o

A minor concern with this change is that this change can result in unexpected behavior if a user ""swaps"" the hostname using the HostnameMap parameter.

    overcloud-controller-0: overcloud-controller-2

However I don't think this usage is quite popular.

Another use case is assigning the same hostname when replacing a node. However in that case we assume the old host no longer exists in the stack, there should not be a problem.

(eg. when replacing the overcloud-controller-0, with keeping the same host name)
```

I'm probably missing your point here. Do you mean tasks wih delegate_to would honor -limit? I don't think that's the case[3]. We still have issues reported when doing upgrade with some broken nodes even after[1]. That's why we came up with a solution[2], may not be the best one but works.

That would not work as play_hosts (hosts for the play) for external tasks is ['undercloud'] and intersection would give nothing. If we use 'difference' instead of 'intersect' it would not honor --limit.

What we instead need is a filter that parses 'ansible_limit' special variable and gives us nodes/groups that are to be excluded from delegate_to. The other option is we get rid of all delegate_to tasks.

Right, that's true for 'overcloud deploy (if --limit is used for scale-out)/upgrade run and there are broken nodes that needs to be excluded, but not for 'overcloud external update/upgrade' where --limit is kind of useless atm.",False,48

> Instead of updating the methods, how about updating the route dispatcher?

After thinking about this; I think this doesn't achieve quite what this is going for.  Setting up a conditional match in the route dispatcher [1] will just mean that the request doesn't match and doesn't trigger the handling function call, and falls through to a 404.  What this is going for is actually matching the request, but if it has an unsupported method rejecting it with a 405

I'm guessing what's happening here is that you're using the gentoo element with something like GENTOO_PROFILE=<something that installs a lot of systemd things> ?

I'd probably say the most appropriate thing is to drop a gentoo/post-install.d/XX-systemd-enable script that does something like

 if [[ ${GENTOO_PROFILE} =~ 'systemd' ]]; then
   ... enable sensible set of services ...
   ... have some set of GENTOO_ namespaced flags if really necessary ...
   ... basically do whatever you want as long as it's sensibly documented ...
 fi
 
ISTM this makes the gentoo element more generically useful.

If you *really* wanted maybe something like the modprobe element could be used.  With that, you can drop a file in an element, and that walks all currently included elements looking for a file that specifies what modules to load ... see modprobe/extra-data.d/50-modprobe-blacklist

It would be something similar where you'd have a ""services-enabled"" file in the element, and then that element would enable those services.  *But*, if dropping this file is only going to work for a single combination of Gentoo+systemd, that doesn't feel compelling TBH.",True,48

This element was originally to be used for the purpose of enabling those services in a newly built image. My thought process was: since this is so simple to create, and could be used for many other things as an enhancement, I would include the ability to call a list of services in case someone else found it useful.  I don't know of any other way other than an environment variable to make that happen.  

Again, open to suggestions. I get you don't want to add ""yet another variable"" but keep in mind, the variable is not required if you don't need the element.  It's not going to arbitrarily clutter up everyone's config.  It's a small element, with a single variable that some people will use, others can ignore if they don't need it.   

I also already mentioned not all packages enable a service by default, such as qemu-guest-agent, even on ubuntu/debian.  For at least my use case, I need that service running on first boot, so I can pull back the IP assigned to the VM from the hypervisor.  Rather than creating a single-use element for qemu-guest-agent, I assumed a better use of my time was to create something that would fit more than just this purpose, while still solving my problem.  

So, package-installs exists, which requires a global variable to provide a list. It's literally the same design concept as this element.  Why is this any different?  If you want me to expand the functionality, sure. I don't mind doing that, but you need to at least let me get my foot in the door first before I commit to something like this only to have the door slammed in my face when I try again.

1. own_sr is not included in the existing_shard_ranges (excludes self) or filtered_other_shard_ranges (excludes self, excludes children, excludes cleaving states), so the overlap check is ok for sub-ranges that overlap with own_sr.

2. otherwise, the assertion is that we never want to have sub-shards with overlaps in a DB that is not yet sharded.

So if one replica of P, P1, is sharding to children A, B and split brain means that another replica P2 is sharding to children C, D: the root may get the overlapping A, B, C, D but P1 and P2 won't merge all four ACTIVE children from root.

If the overlap is fixed then 2 or A, B, C, D will be moved to SHRINKING and then will be excluded from filtered_other_shard_ranges. So P1 and P2 will then merge the remaining 2 ACTIVE sub-shards.

There is this anomaly: meanwhile, peer to peer replication will merge unconditionally so P1 and P2 can end up with A, B, C, D all ACTIVE and I think will just cleave to whichever subset is yielded in order as we iterate shard ranges in the cleave method. Which is OK.

Maybe we could merge overlaps from root? But whatever we do in this patch we're merging more than we did before (apart from when own_sr is shrinking), so NOT merging overlaps is not a regression.

Ancestors (apart from root) are by definition always either sharding or sharded. We never want to shrink to them. That was what caused stalled DBs!

Root can become ACTIVE again for the purpose of shrinking back to root, but that is not fo repair.",True,48

I guess, we're only checking for overlaps based on what the shard has and what was pooled from root, and that isn't including the shard's OSR. And if we were merging one overlap into another, the one that is shrinking would be shrinking itself into 1 or more others that aren't in shrinking and so wouldn't overlap.

What happens if we repair when something has also just decided to cleave/shard. We'd get an overlap then.. but in that case, not merging the overlap, I still think is the best way forward. Let the cleave finish then maybe deal with the repair?

If we assume the root has: 
* stale active grandparent that has re-appeared after the grandparent range was reclaimed from root.
* sharded deleted parent that has been reclaimed (so actually the root does not have this)
* active child shards

and now assume a child shard is moved to sharding: when it updates from root it would be unable to detect the grandparent relationship (because the parent is reclaimed) so it might merge in the grandparent if it has none of its own children (the great-granchildren). If the child has its children then the grandparent will be detected as an overlap and not merged.

If the grandparent is merged, the child will try to shard to it - that is not good 😞 but what happens?

I think that (a) because the grandparent is active, the sharding child will not create the grandparent container. But of course, at least one stale replica of it does exist, and if that is on a current primary then the sharding child will succeed in cleaving to it i.e. replicate_object will succeed. That's bad.

If another replica of the child succeeds in cleaving to the great-grandchildren (the happy path) then eventually the root will report an overlap of grandparent with great-grandchildren. At least we'll get a warning in that case.

But because we allow unconditional shard range replication between peers, once one child has the grandparent then all children will get it, and because we sort shard ranges by upper I think the children might then choose to cleave to the grandparent in preference to their own children.

If all of the children replicas actually cleave to the grandparent then do we end up with some unused great-grandchildren shard ranges in found or created state? These are never reported as overlaps because their state is different to the grandparent. That's bad.

Meanwhile we have a re-incarnated grandparent that one day might need to shard...

The one good thing is that the grandparent probably overlaps with other parent and grandchildren descendants that are not sharding and will therefore be overlapping in ACTIVE state, so we'd get a warning.

But the bottom line is that we really really do not want to cleave to an ancestor.",True,48

There would've had to be a slow replica or split brain for a ancestor to be ACTIVE still, and the split brain would've had to last longer then reclaim_age. So pretty safe.

I guess there is old handoff nodes that where turned off.. but again, if a node is off for > reclaim_age what can we expect. The only way I can see this happening is:

1. split brain while a granparent shards, so one replica remains in ACTIVE state or an handoff is in a split brain.
2. The new shard (parent) shards again and marked deleted as the ACTIVE grandparent node is is taken offline or still in a netsplit.
3. The grandparent node needs to have been offline (due to netsplit or maintenence) longer then the parent is deleted _and_ reclaimed.

But the granparent would have to have been ""offline"" for at least 2x reclaim_ages, because we mark a shardrange OSR as deleted. We then wait a reclaim_age in the shard container audit and finally mark the shard db as deleted (broker.delete_db) which when officially marks the database as deleted.. thus starting a db_replicator recliam_age on delete timestamp before it is deleted.

This seems _really_ unlikely. Esp if we can also use Al's grandparant detection.

If this does happen though.. Ie we have a grandparent that is ACTIVE because of a long offline mode for it's replicas to be gone. But it's SHARDED child is still around, then this code will make sure it isn't added (awesome!). But what happens next? When the parent is reclaimed, there is a legitimate gap, and it could get merged. Although I guess we are probably already detecting an overlap way before we get to that point.
I do wonder if we can use some of the parent/grandparent logic to make audit decisions. Like if we do detect a granparent in ACTIVE state, repair it?",True,48

I haven't yet thought of any way to detect that X is a grandparent of Y given only X and Y.

Thinking more...IF we forced the parent shard's epoch to be the same as the timestamp that is embedded in its children's names, then we might be able to predict the names of child with index N, so we could search to fill a single generation gap:

  given grandparent with epoch T0 and a child:
    for each index N=0,1,...max-N:
      calculate parent name based on hash(grandparent)-epoch-N
      use child.is_child_of(parent_

what should max_N be? in practice we tend to generate 2 or 3 shards from a sharding DB, so choosing max_N ~ 10 would give us good success rate - we'd at least eliminate more cases.

Can I please ask you for a couple of pointers how am I supposed to use the `side_effect` here? In particular what does this `side_effect` need to correspond to?

1) GET request of the SettingsURI
2) self._get_etag()
3) something else (what)?
Also do I need to mock a GET request and make it a parameter of the test to make this work? Basic pseudocode or examples in existing code would be very helpful. I'm hitting a blank trying to visualise it cause so far I've only been explicitly setting eTags like it's done above.

I had a bit of a look into this. I suppose I could have two different sets of headers in json corresponding to each response variant and make sure we load the response to the GET request against settings together with the right header, but thinking about the flow I'm not sure if it will test much. Additionally, the assert already tests the path which is set in the same conditional as eTag so if that passes it's unlikely that the eTag will be incorrect - or at least that's my (possibly naive) thinking?

Looking at other tests against System, all the tests I've seen operate with a single self.conn.get so I am unsure how to deal with a case where we may have two GETs - one against the System and one against the Settings which we're doing here. Or at least not without adding a fair bit of complexity.

I suppose we could have a new separate set of tests that just focus on making sure the right eTag is used and that would inject different Settings responses and monitor how many GET requests to we see and to what URLs (assert against the GETs not the PATCH)? However if we were to do this personally I'd leave this for a follow-up change.

Let me know your thoughts - perhaps I missed a really simple way of sorting this out (if that's the case I'm open to addressing this within this change)

I have one outstanding question though. With Lenovo SE450, I see Boot attribute in SettingsURI but not BootSourceOverrideTarget or BootSourceOverrideEnabled. This itself does not worry me but raises a question: Do we need to worry about cases where BootSourceOverrideTarget is present but BootSourceOverrideEnabled is absent from SettingsURI GET response?

For now I am only checking for BootSourceOverrideTarget as without it we certainly won't be able to do anything useful, but I wonder if this is sufficient. Please see my in-code comment below:

Looking at https://opendev.org/openstack/sushy/src/branch/master/sushy/resources/system/system.py#L215 (set_system_boot_options()) I think there are only three properties that may be used: BootSourceOverrideTarget, BootSourceOverrideEnabled and BootSourceOverrideMode.

For my understanding, there is no point of making a request to the Settings Resource if it doesn't have the BootSourceOverrideTarget property (hence the current conditional - if that's missing I think fallback to System URI is appropriate).

Now - hypothetically, what if Settings Resource has BootSourceOverrideTarget but not BootSourceOverrideEnabled? I don't think having one of these in Settings Resource and the other one under System would be a reasonable implementation (in which I'd disregard it for now)? Or do you think we need to consider such scenario?

In my experience, hardware using Settings Resource for boot management is relatively scarce, I only worked with one machine that manages boot through Settings Resource. This makes it hard to predict what other combination may pop up.

I agree that we may re-think this at some point when/if Settings Resource becomes more widespread but I'd be tempted to try to fix the current problem with the Lenovo SE450 and re-visit this in the future if needed.

In iDRAC current approach would make BootSourceOverrideMode to be patched on active resource that will still work as iDRAC has kept backward compatibility.

I was wondering whether Ansible collections would have to change something as well and the result is: It depends. Removing shebangs is not necessary, but changing the interpreter might be.

Ansible modules are supposed to start with shebang '#!/usr/bin/python' which allows 'ansible_python_interpreter' to work [1]. When no shebang has been specified, then Ansible falls back to '/usr/bin/python' [2]. So when specifying no shebang Ansible behaves as if the file had a shebang of '#!/usr/bin/python'.

What has changed with Ansible 6 (ansible-core 2.13) is Ansible's behaviour when shebang is defined but not '#!/usr/bin/python': Since ansible-core 2.13 the interpreter specified in the shebang will be used instead of 'ansible_python_interpreter'. In fact, 'ansible_python_interpreter' is used as long as the basename of the shebang interpreter is 'python'. For example, with a shebang such as '#!/my/crazy/path/python' Ansible will also use 'ansible_python_interpreter'.

The issue here is non-Ansible-default shebangs such as '#!/usr/bin/env python' or '#!/usr/bin/python3'. Changing them to '#!/usr/bin/python' would work and be Ansible docs conformant 😉

Technical details:

Ansible's _extract_interpreter() reads shebang and interpreter from files [3]. Function _get_shebang() returns the interpreter part of the shebang, e.g. '/usr/bin/python' [4]. This interpreter string will be put into:

  interpreter_name = os.path.basename(interpreter).strip()

which will return the stripped basename of the interpreter [5], e.g. 'python'. When

  interpreter_name == 'python'

then Ansible will use 'ansible_python_interpreter' etc [6]. In other cases Ansible will use the interpreter defined in the shebang, because of this interpreter_name comparison

  os.path.basename(interpreter).strip() == 'python'

(pseudocode for illustration). Example:

  In [1]: os.path.basename('/usr/bin/env python').strip()
  Out[1]: 'env python'

If you were presumably to do some check, it would be to see whether the cert at ca_path matches the ca cert that issued the haproxy cert.

But given that this script runs somewhat infrequently (i.e with haproxy cert renewal), I'm not sure writing a check is necessary.

But I am curious - can you explain why the above check will fail if the local ca cert has been renewed (after half its lifetime), the haproxy cert has been issued with the new ca_cert, and the old ca_cert is still valid (and trusted from the last time this script ran)?",True,48

If we take example of any other non-proxy API, in that case also main service might be calling other service to get/perform something (for example create server, nova interact to glance and neutron also) but we use the main service timeout.

But on the same time, another argument can be, main time in proxy APIs case are proceeded by proxy service only so we can say using proxy service timeout is right choice.

Anyways those APIs are deprecated and not recommended to use so let's go with what we did for volume in client you pointed out. But can you please add same comment here too so that we know why we are using image build timeout here.",True,48

Although i don't agree on the notion that we're keeping name as a positional argument whereas size as an optional one.
""name"" is always optional so rather than changing it's nargs value to optional, I would prefer to make it optional altogether (--name)
""size"" is optional incase of creating from snapshot, volume, backup etc but if the source is not provided and we're creating a normal volume then size is indeed a mandatory argument and would be better suited as positional. We've done it's handling in cinderclient and similar could be done here as well.

- exposing the socket to *any* container, since all of them is using the host network
- as Takashi pointed out, no resource cleanup, this may be useful if customer wants to disable sensuability.


May main concern is, really, exposing the podman TCP socket to the world via the host network :(. We can probably act against this via the firewall though, but it will be complicated (marking packets, filtering on that mark, for instance... Or some similar mechanism)....

Another solution may be:
- dedicated container for sensu
- NOT using network=host, but the podman one (or maybe a brand new, dedicated one)
- expose podman TCP socket on that specific network

AFAIK, that would still allow sensu to push data to collectd, while ensuring we're not exposing the socket to the world (or close to it, since, again, any container may access it).",False,48

we went over the history a bit and disucssed the current supprot in ml2/ovs and ml2/ovn

tl;dr is for ml2/ovs applying min bandwith QOS policies to neutron network is blocked and ml2/ovn does not currently supprot the min bandwith qos.

that will change with this spec but we shoudl not have any existign usage of min bandwith qos with tunneled networks. as a result we do not need to provide an automated upgrade proceedure to reshape the allocations of exsiting ports.

we discussed that there is an existign gap when using min bandwith with phyent backed networks, notably that if you chang the bandwith qos policy config options 
today we do not suport reshapes today for the removal or addtion  of bandwith qos inventories if you have pre existing ports that shoudl NET_BW_EGR_KILOBIT_PER_SEC follow an upgrade.

Also if the instance has any port attached that has resource request (e.g. Quality of Service (QoS): Guaranteed Bandwidth) but the corresponding allocation is not found then the allocation is created against the network device resource providers according to the resource request of that port. It is possible that the missing allocation cannot be created either due to not having enough resource inventory on the host the instance resides on or because more than one resource provider could fulfill the request.

Should I call it _? The structure is not correctly unpacked unless I use .items() and access the value (but not the key). The following from before is not sufficient:

It returns this:

  permissions:

Yes. Not only did I compare it to the approach taken by the libvirt role, I tested both with the same inputs and got the desired outputs for each (aside from needing this small update).

Both tripleo_nova_compute [1] and tripleo_nova_libivrt [2] take the same common input for tripleo_cinder_rbd_multi_config and each does what they need to with it.

> Did you find tests that reuse each other in tempest? Because I wasn't able to find any. By test I mean a function which has an idempotent_id.

Here's the exact pattern in this patch, in tempest:

https://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/f1d0e395e95d3502a9c3904ce56520d116e6bf48/tempest/api/compute/servers/test_server_actions.py#L201-L251

Multiple things call_test_rebuild_server(). One is just a wrapper with an idempotent_id, and another in the class builds on that with some other stuff before and after (two tests down).

> I think that tempest project is a bit different from unit tests from other projects. Tempest tests are for example used in project like Refstack. We need to keep some structure with them. If I run some test in Refstack I want to be sure that I just run a single test not twenty other test.

But you can certainly do that - this approach doesn't change your ability to run one test in the slightest. I think what you're describing here is ""no tests can have any overlap in their expectations or assertions"" which I definitely do not think is accurate. If one test is a total superset of another test, then there's really no reason it shouldn't call the exact test case. In fact, it's better because all the assertions of the simpler case are replicated in the larger one, not just all the setup. If someone comes along later and adds some assertion to the simpler case (due to a bug discovered, for example), they're likely to find the test that clearly matches the operation they're fixing. Cascading the tests (where appropriate) means the more complicated cases all get the same assertion.

To use your case, if I want to run just one test from refstack, and that is the superset case, I would surely hope that it is asserting all the behaviors of the dependent operations. Without it, you could end up with a ""create..update..delete"" test case that doesn't do all the assertions on the create behavior _pass_ when it shouldn't because the create behavior isn't proper, and it doesn't assert everything about it that the base ""create"" case does. Either all those assertions need to be replicated in the superset case, or it will be incomplete. If anything, the cascading of test cases _bolsters_ the scenario of ""I should be able to pick any one case from the list of tests and it should work in isolation"". IMHO of course :)

2) Common functions for the test suite.
3) And the tests (that use the common functions from section 2).

If I am about to write a new test in this class I can just take a look at the common functions which are already implemented. Then I would start to write the new test knowing all the common functions that I can use in this new test.

Ok, agreed.

The original code iterated over all the subnets of a port and appended the associated network to a list. So if I'm reading the original code correctly, the output list for a port that belongs to 2 subnets would look like:

ls = ['network1', 'network1']

Now, the current code would just return

ls = ['network1']

@Lukas, for your resource sharing comment, it does not matter how we execute the code from single test/function, it will always create the seperate resources and all test work on their created resources and cannot clash with each other. so structure and working wise it is all good but its just the logging mechanism making this approach hard to debug.",True,48

2. test_set_multiple_locations execution: 
 
This test execution also log the request with *ImageLocationsTest:test_set_location* id as shown below so it become difficult to tell whether this request from which test execution until we trace the image id and find which test operating on that image id.

Obviously that only includes cases where people have used the ""_test_*"" pattern, and wouldn't even catch things like this, which is ""_check_*()"".

Inspecting the actual results to make sure they apply, here's a common pattern I see all over the place:

        self._test_get_sorted_with_limit_marker(sort_by='launched_at')

Which does a bunch of things and asserts state about them, but also takes parameters. Called from multiple test_*() top-levels.

Here's a more direct example of what I had before, which is test_servers_get() which directly builds on top of self.test_servers_post():

Did you find tests that reuse each other in tempest? Because I wasn't able to find any. By test I mean a function which has an idempotent_id.

I think that tempest project is a bit different from unit tests from other projects. Tempest tests are for example used in project like Refstack. We need to keep some structure with them. If I run some test in Refstack I want to be sure that I just run a single test not twenty other test.

My belief is that reusing tests within each other is not a good practice at least in the current setting. In this patch it is OK but once you cross this line it is hard to distinguish between tests that are OK to reuse inside other tests and those that are not. 

Also, another point is that it puts more pressure on the test writer in future to find tests that are OK to reuse. By declaring a separate function for a resource creation it's like saying: ""Hey, here is a piece of code that can be reused in future tests"". In contrast, if you put the resource creation only in a test it might not be immediately obvious that the test can be reused. 

To be honest I didn't even think about the logger thing and this seems important too.

@gmann, yes I understand this. In this patch, I agree that it is OK but I can imagine cases in which reusing tests inside each other is not a good idea. And as this is the first test suite that uses this practice I think that it sets a precedence which might be difficult to change in the future.

1) I think that a test function should be a close unit of code that does testing and nothing else. Usually test consists of three stages: setup (creation of resources), testing (you do something to the resources), and teardown (the resources are destroyed). When test A is used for creation of a resource in test B and test B fails then it is hard to tell whether it failed because the resource got ""dirty"" during the testing phase in test A or because there is actually something wrong with test B. 
 
Because of that, I think it is better to have the logic for creation of resources separated from the testing logic. Using a test for creation of a resource always carries the chance that the resource is influenced by the testing phase. 

It does not look like the test_set_location() is doing something ""dirty"" with the image. It just creates it and checks whether it is created. But I think that it would be better to keep the same approach throughout tempest. I'm not sure but I think that tempest does not contain test cases that reuse each other. 

2) Readability wise something like `image = get_image_with_location()` looks better to me than `image = test_set_location()`.

Sean, we have discussed this several times. Placement API has no way to model a physical resource with two RP and share the inventory.

What we decided in Neutron is to make a 1:1 assignation between a network and it's physical bridge. This is why currently we only support physical backed networks in Neutron.

""i do not think we shoudl implemnte this feature without supproting this configuration."" That means we should also provide the ability of model one RP shared between two physical networks (without even considering adding the support for tunnelled networks). I would say it again: in Neutron we do a 1:1 between networks and physical devices (model as physical bridges, both in ML2/OVN and ML2/OVS). This RFE is extending this support for tunnelled network, considering that this traffic will go through the ""local_ip"", assigned to an independent network interface.

In other words, this spec is not considering creating a RP shared between two networks. Each RP will have a 1:1 match with a physical network or the ""local_ip"" interface. Each RP will have its own inventory. The case you are describing is a corner case, when the ""local_ip"" is using the same interface of a physical bridge.",False,48

Am I correct in that we are not supporting this to shared set due to the fact that VMs float automatically across the shared set so that with a single VM booted on the host the whole shared set need to be in usable state already. So the only saving we could do is to turn off CPUs in the shared set while no VM is running on the host.

i would personally use

cpu_governors=['powersave','schedutil']

reduce perfomcne vs schedutil and it will use more power vs schedutil or ondemand

if we were to have such an interface i would crete a very small client/server lib that uses a unix socket and comunciate betwen the two with a narrow provision/deporvision interface.


that would allow use to avoid the api change/external event and make the syncronisation simipler.


all nova woudl do is call provsion like it does with os-vifs plug-vifs function.

that internally woudl write a serialsied ovo to the unix socket and then do a read to get the ACk. both the write and read io operation will be monkey patched
by eventlet allowing the greenthread to yeild allowing nova ot work on other operatiosn while we wait for the external agent to complete it work.

that keeps a nice seperation between teh adress space and exectution envrionment 
of the nova compute agent and external agent.


over time we could eventually evolve that interface to allow the external agent to provition addtional host resouces such as lvm volumes, usb devices, cpu cache similar to how we integrate with cyborg. i.e. the external agent can mange the provisoning and depovisioning of a host resocue an retrun a abstrcat represtation of a resouce to be included itn eh domain xml.

i.e. a pci adrees, mdev uuid or other handel to the device.

some usecasuse i think coudl be address in the futre this way are as follows.
- as an vnf vendor with low latency requirements i would like to be able to allocate a host, partion, lvm volume, local block device or directory to a tenant workload.
- as an operator i would like to offer usb passthough of host devices such as gps recivers or hardware debuggers or other sepcialsied usb hardware for ci/test/industiral workloads.

jsut looking at that first usecasue today passing through say a nvme disk to a vm
we can do that with pci passthough already but we do not supprot that as the disk woudl not be cleaned. it would be trivial ot allow and external agent to do that cleanign when the vm is deleted or moved to another host.


havign a generic interface to delegate host resouce provisioning ot a local agent outside of nova would allow nova to focus on what its good at and allow that external agent to have a narrow focus, provsioing/deprovisioning resouces on a host.

im not suggesting we have to do this now or that this is nessisarly the best cours of action thre are alternitives i just want to reraise this alternitive architecture.

i do think haveing  a init/provision/deprovision interface with a unix socket transport (similar to how we talk to privsep) would actually be less invasive and more evolvable over time.",True,48
861591,specs/2023.1/approved/external-cpu-management.rst,11604,3,c8dacddc_062b9763,Line,140,,2022-10-17 11:21:16,"this is ture provided the scope of the external deamon does not include prepareing a resouce that will be passedthrough to the guest.

so for example configuring a cpu cache allocation could be doen without any changes to nova

allocating a directory to be passthgouh through via virtiofs or a usb device or any other CUSTOM_ resouce class that corresponds to a consumable host resouce that is directly passhtough to the guest would need some minimal change to nova.

it woudl be almsot identical to how cycborg integrates however.

i.e. to passthough a mdev that it had prepared we would just need to give nova the uuid, for a pci device we woudl jsut need a pci address.

so if we wanted to allow the geneirc resouce manamgnet case we just need two parmaters and ""identifier/handel"" and a ""bus/connecot_type"" e.g.

{""handle"":""72d8bc3d-9c96-4d03-80f9-3a4ace5128d9"", ""type"":""mdev""}
{""handle"":""3e:00.0"", ""type"":""pci""}
{""handle"":""/mnt/fast/nova/72d8bc3d-9c96-4d03-80f9-3a4ace5128d9"", type:""hostpath""}
{""handle"":""/dev/mapper/lvm--volumes-volume--20a03a7a--8481--4a4a--aecb--5ff10e60d6ef"", ""type"":""blockdev""

realistically that structure should have status and error/message fields too so that we can signal failure if required. and it woudl either need to be an ovo or have a version field but those are not important right now.

to support this usecase which i admit is out of scope of this current spec nova would just need a list of externally manmabale types and a handeler for each that a driver (libvirt) would provide to generate teh relevent xml for that type.

this is what we do for cybrog managed resouces today so this woudl be reusabel code that coudl be use by nova,cyborg or externally managed reousces.


how i wudl see this working is we would use

""resource:"" in the flavor to request the allocation of the resouce which could be reported via provider.yaml or by the external agent directly to placment, in combination with one/two addtiona flavor extra spec keys

i woudl hope one ""external_resouces:CUSTOM_EXT_1,CUSTOM_EXT_2""  would be enough just a comma seperated list fo resouce that we would delegate to the external agent to manage.

the ohter key i was thinking of is ""external_resouce_group:...""
it woudl be the same but a list if resource groups instead of resouce classes.
i dislike that option because it requires operators to use resouce_groups in teh flavor and i dont like that.",True,48

* Not only does JobData rarely change, but the objects that hold JobData (which are either FrozenJob or Build objects) also rarely change.
* The comment above is explaining why we are using a paused job: that is one of the times when a Build is refreshed, and that is a necessary pre-requisite to refreshing a Build's JobData.  In other words, to even have a chance of calling the code that decides whether or not to refresh a Build's JobData from ZK, we first have to call the code that refreshes Build.
* That means that ""refreshPipelines"" doesn't always refresh every object in all the pipelines.
* So if we want to verify that we are re-using JobData objects, we need to refresh a pipeline when it is in a condition where it will decide that it needs to refresh the Build so that we can test our JobData reuse code.

So to answer your question: refreshPipelines *does* cause us to execute the JobData hash matching code because the content of the pipeline is a paused build.  If it were any other build, we wouldn't even get that far so the test would not be useful.",False,48

if any of 1, 2 or 3 has changed then we don't want to override the logic which is causing a new pyc file to be created. The only exception would be a pyc file that has the same contents but that itself has different file attributes.

I am not satisfied with a generic explanation, we need to know exactly why the pyc files are changing. Ideally finding and fixing whatever is the root cause instead of attempting to handle things at this stage.

I think this change can be WF+1. I may change the others with WF-1 without problems.

If I understood correctly, the ""depends-on"" in the others changes should guarantee that they will not be merged before this one.
I understood that Workflow -1 or -2 can be used when code is in WIP or it needs a manual setup before code merge.

""Cross-Repository Dependencies""

""Do not add a Depends-On an abandoned change, your change will never merge.""

The -1 is for this specific case: what happens if an operator has already deployed Ironic on a DB that is set to utf8mb4 -- won't all our existing (and future) migrations break those users pretty aggressively?

I'm not sure how we get out of this without forcing a hard migration for *someone*, but being explicit about encoding in our migrations, when we haven't before, is likely to put an operator in a position where something is broken in a difficult-to-fix way that may have otherwise been unpredictable.

In fact, I'm fairly sure that today, if an operator performed these steps; they'd likely be broken already:
- Dump ironic DB without create table statements (a valid way to dump/backup DBs)
- Run ironic DB creation tool on a new DB that's running *newer* mysql/mariadb/etc
- Import your DB
- Operator finds out, after the fact, values are truncated.



I think this attempt to solve this ... DB mismatch quietly is laudable; but we're better off making loud noises and requiring operators to manually validate or migrate than just changing these out from under them. Essentially we have a minefield of operator DBs out there, waiting to blow up when/if exported from their existing DB server into a new one.",True,48

This is meant to be a neutral change.
For some reason, the try-except block in this file sometimes does catch the exception as it should, throwing an error for which there already exists an ""except"" clause implemented and halting code execution.
This commit is not supposed to change anything about the logic, just the code syntax by swapping the try-except block for a built-in python function.

It fixes one of the intermittent failure points in the framework, but there are others.

Ideally I would want to execute this on `stop` event, however I found out that at this point the certificates are already removed from the unit and `ovn-appctl` command can no longer communicate with the rest of the cluster, therefore it's unable to leave cluster gracefully.
I think it makes most sense to execute this code when `certificates` relation emits the `broken` event because regardless if it's happening because the unit is being removed (juju remove-unit) or the relation is removed (juju remove-relation) this unit will no longer be capable of participating in the cluster and should attempt to leave it gracefully.

It should be noted that even if the code is placed in this hook I did not achieve 100% success rate of graceful departure. It still occasionally happens that unit is not capable of executing the `ovn-appctl cluster/leave` command. Therefore the charm-guide about cluster downscaling should mention that operator should check output of the `cluster-status` action and manually kick any servers that were left behind after the unit removal.

I do not like this as it kinda depends on a race condition to be able to execute `ovn-appctl` command before the certificates disappear so if you have any suggestion on how to better place this code in the lifecycle I'd be very grateful.

Now to your points:

>  Re-joining the certificates relation does not mean the unit is leaving the cluster.

I'm not sure I understand this point. This code is executed only when `certificate-relation-broken` event is emitted and it happens only once. Either when the unit is removed or when the relation is removed. Re-joining certificates relation should not trigger this code. Or am I missing something?


> What happens if the cluster never formed or the charm code has not yet installed on the unit?

This function is designed to fail gracefully. If the unit is removed before the cluster is formed (or before the charm software is installed), the worst thing that happens is that two ERROR messaged will be logged (I'm open to changing this to WARNING btw.)

Correct me if I misunderstood you but I feel like you are suggesting that this code will be executed periodically during the installation (and cluster setup) until the certificates become available. However I tested this and unless I misunderstood the documentation [0], this should really be executed only once per unit or relation removal.

After removing the certificates relation the certificate data remains on disk, so if you have observed them not being there in the stop hook something else in the charm or package life cycle has removed them.

Looks like some more work is needed to identify what is going on and how to best deal with the unit departure sequence.

Perhaps the one thing I can think of is that this way, if there are any ""abandoned"" servers, the information is scattered throughout the ""Servers"" dict in form of `Unit: ""UNKNOWN""`. Whereas if there was a dedicated dict mapping units to servers the ""abandoned"" servers could be mapped under single key like ""UNKNOWN"".

But then there's a question about the structure of the list. Every unit should host single server (correct?) so it would make sense to have `Dict[str, str]`. However there can be multiple abandoned servers (if multiple units went missing) so the final structure would be `Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]`. Example:
```
unit_map:
  ovn-central/0: aa11
  ovn-central/1: bb22
  UNKNOWN:
    - cc33
    - dd44
```
I don't really like this struct and it would introduce more complications for parsing it (on the side that would consume data from this action). What do you think?",True,48

We want to retain as much or all of this history as possible.

e.g,
Subject: kubelet cpumanager disable CFS quota throttling for
 Guaranteed pods

This disables CFS CPU quota to avoid performance degradation due to
Linux kernel CFS quota implementation. Note that 4.18 kernel attempts
to solve the CFS throttling problem, but there are reports that it is
not completely effective.

This disables CFS quota throttling for Guaranteed pods for both
parent and container cgroups by writing -1 to cgroup cpu.cfs_quota_us.
Disabling has a dramatic latency improvement for HTTP response times.

This patch is refactored in 1.22.5 due to new internal_container_lifecycle
framework. We leverage the same mechanism to set Linux resources as:
cpu manager: specify the container CPU set during the creation

Users will expect to have 22.03 installed if they choose track 22.03. I've done this on Focal and it worked fine (our documentation also states that track 22.03 can already be used with Focal). IIUC, due to the ovn-chassis subordinate charm, it is not possible to guarantee that 22.03 will be installed using current methods but it would be if a new UCA pocket was used. It is this change that the release note should be pointing out. 

Please validate this suggested text:

===
On Focal, deployments of the OVN charms when using track 22.03 (``--channel 22.03/stable``) will use a new PPA-backed UCA pocket. This is to ensure that a machine can simultaneously have OpenStack components from one source and OVN components from another.

This has no effect when upgrading the OVN charms or when scaling an existing application (new units). However, a new configuration option `ovn-source`_ has been added that can override this behaviour (i.e. payload upgrades will be triggered by charm upgrades and scaling).

Both the existing cloud archive pockets and the new one are PPA-backed, so I'm not sure if it's useful to point that out in this context. What about ""...will use a new OVN specific UCA pocket"" instead?

The OVN charms in track 22.03 and later now default to installing OVN 22.03 for fresh deployments on Focal. This has no effect when upgrading the OVN charms or when scaling an existing application (new units). However, a new configuration option `ovn-source`_ has been added that can override this behaviour (i.e. payload upgrades will be triggered by charm upgrades and scaling).

How do other charms work in terms of charm upgrades and application scaling not affecting what latest/stable is pointing at? It looks like there is something particular going on here when maybe it shouldn't?

+++++++++++++++++++++

Off-topic,

I do find option `ovn-source` dubious in terms of its ability to influence what payload version gets installed. This seems to be in conflict with the central notion of channels.

There is also a lot of wording in this option's description (config.yaml) that needs improvement and clarification:

* terminology ""overlay repository"" is new (to me)
* we're hardcoding versions (not great)
* it's not clear what values can be used",True,48

I think I need to rephrase it with N-1->N and N-2->N example and with SLURP and non-SLURP as N release so that it will be more clear to understand.",False,48

I guess what we want to avoid in non-SLURP is adding new things to PTI. But non-SLURP is likely a release when you want to drop old PTI from N-3. Because for non-SLURP N-1, N and N+1 should have same PTI. Example:


+------+------+------+--------+--------+--------+
|      | Yoga | Zed  | 2023.1 | 2023.2 | 2024.1 |
+------+------+------+--------+--------+--------+
|20.04 | Yes  | Yes  | Yes    | No     | No     |
+------+------+------+--------+--------+--------+
|22.04 | No   | Yes  | Yes    | Yes    | ???    |
+------+------+------+--------+--------+--------+

So what I meant, is that we are dropping old stuff on non-SLURP and adding new stuff on SLURP. But both are changes in PTI.

Also, this table makes me thing if we should drift release schedule a bit to allow Ubuntu get released before OpenStack to make it part of the deal or switch what we say SLURP is and what non-SLURP, as otherwise we might stuck with platform a bit more then we want to.",True,48

With that I feel like we should mention explicitly about what (distro new version) is mainly/latest supported/tested in SLURP release (if we are supporting two version) and what (distro old version) we are keeping for smooth upgrade from previous release (N-1 -> N) upgrade. That way it will be explicitly known that SLURP keeping distro old version for smooth upgrade from N-1 to N and not for N -> N+1 upgrade. This distro old version will be removed in next non-SLURP release.

I will add it in testing runtime to be explicit about it.",False,48

When starting the kubelet process, two separate sets of reserved CPUs
may be specified.  With this change CPUs reserved via
'--system-reserved=cpu'
or '--kube-reserved=cpu' will be ignored by kubernetes itself.  A small
tweak to the default CPU affinity ensures that ""normal"" Kubernetes
pods won't run on the reserved CPUs.

 keep using platform-nfs-ip ( and don't apply any changes in create_sm_db.sql )

or

Remove the platform-nfs-ip, and do not add platform-export-fs depends-on management-ip. And replace platform-nfs-ip with platform-nfs-ip in the dependencies from keystone/sysinv-conductor.
 
or 

Remove all lines that were using platform-nfs-ip in the dependency table. ( I don't think this is correct ).

I will show the file changes to Bin Qian.",True,48

I understand why the code in this file may look like it contains repetitive code, but at the same time I personally like the structure of the file and I find it easy to read - based on the length of the file as well as the length of the repeated code, this is the situation where we need to weigh 'easy to ready and understand' against just a few repeated lines ... and I personally vote 'easy to read and understand' in this situation. 

That said, we could wrap (in a separate patch) the following lines:
```
        snapshot_name = data_utils.rand_name('test-snap')
        image = self.create_image_from_server(server['id'],

        self.addCleanup(self.client.delete_image, image['id'])
```
into a helper method but we really need to ask ourselves whether its worth it - we'll save 10 maybe 15 lines of code but we'll gain a new method we need to trace when we debug the tests ... I'm really not sure if that's worth it in this particular case",False,48

Agree. In your example case you also need to either assert or return the name so that the tests that do that keep that coverage. If I have to scroll away from a ten-line test to determine if a helper is asserting something on behalf of the test, that's a loss of readability that outweighs a little code reuse, IMHO.",False,48

1. creating test_server
2. taking a snapshot of the test_server

I agree the scenario tested in the patch is valid but we also need to take into account that we are repeating the code which has already been repeated multiple times.

Can we find a solution for this? 
Something like..

1. create_snapshot() -> an internal method which can be used by all the tests
2. use above method here[6]

Same goes with all of them..we need a refactoring there as well.

That said, I don't think this makes the situation worse than it is, and in fact mirrors the behavior of the tests above it right? Refactoring the tests might be a good idea, but I'd rather have that be in a separate patch than this one that just adds the test. That makes the history cleaner and future problem determination easier to point to the refactor or the test.
