1. reserve is called in nova-api before casting off to the compute to attach the volume; this avoids blocking calls to cinder from nova-api but changes the state on the volume while doing this other work.
2. initialize and attach are called from the compute on the reserved volume.

With this new API, would nova-api be calling the blocking create_attachment method or would nova-compute?

This user story is arising from some discussions at the Glance operators' virtual mid-cycle last week.  What I took from that discussion are these points, which I probably should have made more explicit:

* There is definite interest in some kind of image lifecycle definition, or at least in keeping ""retired"" images out of the default image-list

* Not everyone is in agreement about whether the ""retired"" images should be discoverable, or if they are, how this should work (restricted access or all users)

* There's interest in some way to expand the default image-list so that specific end users see more images

* There's interest in some way to restrict the default image-list so that specific end users see fewer images

It's not clear whether all the above could be implemented by one feature or would require different implementations, so we'd like to get the user stories refined (and reflecting operator concerns) in order to figure that out.

One thing that was received favorably was a suggestion that the Glance image-list would give operators a ""hook"" (on the analogy with Drupal, which provides a mechanism for site-specific code to be run at particular points, one of which is when a collection has been assembled; the hook is run and can modify the list content).  My personal view is that approach should be a last resort for the case where the use cases are so disparate that there's no way to capture them as a coherent whole.",False,22

I think I'd put it in terms of versioning as opposed to parent-child relations, though, since at least in some clouds, each image would be a stand-alone image occurring in a series such that image version n+1 contains all the changes from versions 1 .. n.  The problem is that the version number doesn't really tell you anything about what's actually on the image, so you might as well just use the created_at or updated_at property on the image to figure out the ordering.

I know of one cloud that was using image metadata to provide something like an image_id (e.g., 207 == CentOS 7) and an image sequence number (e.g., 2) to make it easier to find the the series of available images for a particular image, but it started to get confusing (I think CentOS has had 3 releases of CentOS 7 (what in the old days would be CentOS 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2, but now they just call it ""CentOS 7""); should these get the same image_id or different ones?) and the team that actually uploaded the images decided it was stupid and stopped using the metadata.

So I don't know if this is a hidden requirement or not.  It's definitely complicated, and could possibly be addressed by a well-defined scheme that would be interoperable across OpenStack clouds, if operators decided to use it.  But it's not clear to me at this point if this would be something to be enforced by Glance or by the QE team of each cloud (for example, making sure the sequence number for each public image uploaded is greater than all the current sequence numbers for that image_id).",False,22

* I want to build the latest image, the latest Ubuntu 16.04 say, and I should be able to do that the same across all clouds

* Generally users should bootstrap their software into an existing cloud image, such that they pick an image that will be optimised for best performance in their chosen cloud. The performance of the base OS should general be dealt with (silently, were possible) by the deployer of the cloud.

* Once I have a tested combination working, I don't want that to change until I have QAed the new image.

* At some point an operator wants to retire an image, perhaps because of extremely serious security issues, or its know to have a serious bug (keeps blue screening, etc).

I think the first one is probably best dealt with by a different spec for ""consistent image discoverability across openstack clouds"", which could be a best-practices document that would leverage Glance metadefs (a little-known feature that allows an operator to define metadata fields and associated values for particular openstack resources).  The user story would help define what metadata keys and values would be necessary, and then the Glance team can make sure that those metadefs are available by default.

So, let me explain this a little bit.

map basically calls _log_and_attach function with each element in the block_device_mapping and it returns a list with each result. No surprise here.

The thing is, py34's map returns an iterator. Meaning that _log_and_attach function is NOT called, unless the iterator is iterated through. list will basically loop through the iterator.

The thing is, without this, the block_device_mapping's connection_info would be None, meaning that all volume related unit tests would fail on py34. You can verify my claim through the fact that py34 tests passed succesfully, and that the volume related unit tests were removed from the exclude list.

* for ""retired"" images, some operators feel it's sufficient to keep these out of the default image list (so users won't come across them casually), but otherwise want them to be treated as normal images

* other operators say they'd like to restrict the use of ""retired"" images to specific users ... but should this be only for ""retired"" images, or a more general feature allowing restricted image downloads (per-image) via policies?

that is correct.

> Maybe you should reuse Exception.__cause__ on Python 3? (but dbe.caused_during_handling_by on Python 2?)

the problem here is that making this very specific linkage that occurs in a very specific case match that of __cause__ would be very difficult and error prone, and would always be at the risk of behaving differently, causing test suites to fail and version-specific behaviors in Openstack applications.    Ideally, if Py2 had *any* way of doing what py3.__cause__ does, that would solve this whole problem.   But it seems to be completely impossible, even by doing stack inspection (but if you want to work on this, it would be a huge win. )

> The most simple solution working on Python 2 and Python 3 and avoiding reference cycles issues is to store the exception as text, not as an object. The traceback module contains various functions to format an exception as text.

the exception object here is not being kept alive ""too long"".  It's dealt with inside of a function that is invoked within the except: block and it is discarded outside of the function and hence the ""except:"" block.  The overall case only occurs in an extremely specific scenario that is not frequent or widespread.

Exception throws are very expensive in any case, the throw we're talking about here is in the context of a whole database transaction failing which is in the dozens if not hundreds of milliseconds, so even if a few more cycles were generated, that's short work for a 2 millisecond gc run.  There's lots more reference cycles than that in Openstack and its hundreds of dependencies.

You should know that Py2K's issue here has been my problem for many, many months.  If you feel that you have new insights on solving it, that would be very helpful: see https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1590298 for the neutron issue and https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/issues/2696/misleading-exception-triggered-on for the upstream.  In upstream, we merely emit a warning where we are unable to attach __cause__.  However, Neutron now needs to be able to intercept this nested error and inspect it.",False,22

Option 1: Take the back up and restore it once the EFI partition is mounted. We do not need to call grub-install.

Option 2: Take the back up of EFI. Call grub-install let it install what ever is needed(just like in any other case). Replace EFI related stuff as grub-install will only break for EFI.

In either way, L115-125 is needed to backup the existing contents before mounting efi partition and L147-159 to restore. The reason being, once we mount the /boot/EFI on efi partition the contents are lost, then how does it get the boot loader?

The following options have been identified for services which don't generate notifications.

Change the service to send notifications using the OSLO messaging libraries.
Create a Searchlight client library which can be used by the service to directly update ElasticSearch. This library will need to stay aligned with its associated Searchlight API plugin to ensure that the data mappings, resource types, and target indices stay in sync.
Create a client library which is similar to option 2 but does not add any additional dependencies.  The library will not have any dependencies and will use http client to directly communicate with ElasticSearch for sending updates (rather than the ElasticSearch python client library).
Option 1 is the recommended option for resiliency. Without it, the source service must take ownership of handling ElasticSearch downtime as well as handling all data consistency checks.

If notifications cannot be sent due to some restrictions on source service, the next best option would be 2 and then 3.

Option 2 and 3 will have the disadvantage of not utilizing the full capabilities of searchlight like zero down time reindexing [0].

[0] Searchlight provides a feature called zero downtime re-indexing where an administrator can on-demand rebuild the indexes from various sources without any noticeable disruption to end users.

The dynamic credential provider would start assigning this role to all users (v2 and v3) regardless of other roles they may have and I don't believe that's a desired behaviour. 

The current logic is that if the identity version in use is v3 and not other role has been assigned yet, then Member will be assigned because in v3 a user must have a role explicitly assigned onto a projects for things to work.

The pre-provisioned credential provider does not expect by default any role to be specified for the accounts (primary and alt), which is good enough for most tests in devstack deployment in the gate. In case of v3 credentials a role is required though, so I believe the solution could be found in having in pre-provisioned credentials provider a logic symmetric with what is done in the dynamic one, that is:
- define a new type which can be used to signify the list of roles configured in tempest_roles
- if not type and no role is found for an account, and if identity_version == v3, exclude it from the list of usable hashes

The alternative is of course to stop the v2/v3 differentiation, and always require a role for v2 credentials as well. It would make the logic simpler, but I would prefer not too, since it may break people already using pre-provisioned credentials for v2.

More opinions on this are welcome.",False,22

The flow of the notification process is this:

1. Start attempting to set power on a node.
2. Notify that we're starting this change, passing along what the change should be (the target power state). Notify that we failed if we fail early.
3. Update the node's target_power_state and perform the change.
4. Notify that the change succeeded or failed.

With the SCHEMA fields, those are auto-filled from the Node object. However, we want to notify immediately when we're starting a power state change since we could fail out before updating the Node object in step 2. The Node object is not updated at this point in time, so if we filled the schema there, we wouldn't be able to tell what the target power state was when the failure occurred.

I think the documentation on SCHEMA is pretty comprehensive in the dev docs and code itself. I can update this comment if there's a better way to phrase it, or improve the SCHEMA docs in the patch set this depends on.

> it is always possible for the user to avoid ever booting the malicious image.

I think this is a good goal, but we need to be prepared for cases where we don't catch it. We could have an adversary who has a trusted certificate, and we don't know that his signed images are bad yet. This information would be nice for an ongoing investigation. If this information is available to be queried then we may be able to notice patterns about who is signing malicious images.

Consider a bunch VMs that get compromised. We could look at who provided them and this may provide more information.

I also like this feature from a personal point of view as well. I like to look at certificate chains. I know I'm not normal for this, and I agree that the chain is useless for most users. I don't think it hurts to have this additional information.

> I think it is critical that we can be able to provide a signature with the boot request

The downside about this approach is where will you keep the signature? What would prevent an attacker from modifying that as well? Users can't always recreate the signature because not all users will have the private key. Plus I would need access to known pristine image, and the time would painful.

I'm trying to think if providing the signing certificate would be enough. What do you think about that? Could we provide just that? Essentially this would say that the signing certificate must be this exact certificate. Then the rest of the validation proceeds as normal if and only if they are identical. I think that would work instead of providing the actual signature. Certificate repositories are already out there and in public, so getting that would be much easier than signature. Thinking out loud here, so I hope this makes sense.",False,22

I would be fine with seeing an API extension to report just the signature associated with the image, as that's merely a moderately short hex string that can be verified by simple comparison against what they originally provided to glance. It doesn't require the user to interpret any x509 certificate data to validate it.

Despite this I think it is critical that we can be able to provide a signature with the boot request, so that it is always possible for the user to avoid ever booting the malicious image. That should be the number 1 goal IMHO. Verification after booting is always the worse option.

The problem where glance returns Bob's image to Fred's request can also be mitigated against by allowing users to have their own signing certs, and associating certs with users in openstack. eg Fred should be able to say he only wants nova to boot images signed by Fred's cert, and not by Bob's cert.",False,22

[snip]  my replies to this spec have mostly been focusing on dealing with the case of a malicious glance which provides incorrect information back to nova. I believe what I describe copes with that attack scenario fine.

Your examples here outline a different attack scenario not mentioned in the use cases of this spec. In the case you describe, you have an attacker signing bogus images and then uploading them to glance. In this scenario glance itself is not compromised and working fine. As such, if we want to see where a VM's disk image came from, we can simply ask glance about that image - I'm not seeing the need for nova to expose the certificate validation chain to trace that.

If we want to expand the use cases section in this spec to cover other types of attack that is fine of course. We just need to be clear about what attacks we're aiming to protect against and validate the design against those stated problems

> I agree that the chain is useless for most users. I don't think it hurts to have this additional information.

Every new feature we add has a direct cost for ongoing maint of nova codebase, as well as consuming time from reviewers which is already in demand. As such we definitely avoid adding features just because we can - we want to see clear compelling user need for features we add - ""it doesn't hurt"" is not justification enough.

> The downside about this approach is where will you keep the signature?

WRT providing the signature at time of boot, the user whom uploaded the image originally will have the signature they originally provided to glance, and so would be able to 
provide it to nova again when booting. Alternatively organization may have a list of their trusted signatures maintained in a secure location outside the cloud that they use when booting trusted instances

> I'm trying to think if providing the signing certificate would be enough. 

Just providing the signing certificate does not allow us to protect against the case where the same user has uploaded multiple images signed with the same cert. eg user may upload a RHEL-7.2 disk image initially, then a security alert comes out, so they upload a newer version of that image. THey want assurance that Nova is actually booting the updated image and that glance hasn't substituted the old vulnerable image. Since you can't trust glance to provide the signature itself and the signing cert can't be used to distinguish the images, the only option is to provide the signature to nova directly.",False,22

You have to open up advanced info, and manually add an exception before it'll let you continue. This is part of a general trend away from presenting security information to users & asking them to make decisions on it, and encouraging them to just accept the decisions made by the browser.

Since we're building from a clean-slate here, I really think we should strive for a similar situation where the user provides initial input (valid certs/sigs) and then lets nova make the decision, and *not* build a system where the user is expected to view & analyse certificate chains.",False,22

I just checked the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, and they all display this information simply by clicking the padlock icon.

On a less pedantic level, one goal of the image signature validation feature as a whole is that it should be as transparent as possible to the end user The end user should be able to easily check that their image's signature was verified, that the signing cert is familiar to them (either theirs or another entity that they trust), and that there's cryptographic assurance that the signing certificate is trustworthy.

  - Nova verifies signature BBB against image YYY and succeeds.
  As a result Fred is *not* running the image which they originally
  uploaded - they are instead running an image from Bob.

In this case, the signature is valid but the user has no way to detect that a different image has been booted. One possibility to address this issue is to allow the user to specify the signature (""AAA"" in the example above) as part of the boot request. That approach has the drawback of not being transparent to the user -- i.e., the signature must be provided. Another possibility is to allow the user to check the signature after the fact, which is the approach described here. This approach has the advantage of being transparent to the user and allows the user to do additional checking only if they're inclined to do so.",False,22

It is essentially punting the problem of identifying validation to the client user or app, and experience of web browsers shows they'll likely just ignore it, or not understand it, or get validation wrong, or all of the above.

This approach of reporting certs for the instance and having the user verify them means that there is no way to actually prevent the VM being booted from an image with invalid certs. You have to boot the image, then query the cert chain, then verify it, and then kill the instance if the verification failed. I think that's really awful - for this to be credible, we should be able to prevent us getting anywhere near booting the instance. We should have a system that lets us immediately stop the boot request the moment we've checked the image cert chain.",False,22

One of the primary reasons for this feature is to not trust Glance. The signature is there to protect against Glance modifying it. Therefore we cannot ask Glance about the image.

I see the benefit in that security people can view the certificate of what was booted. We can identify anomalous or malicious behavior. I think this is beneficial in public clouds where a user wants to verify the integrity of the image.

> Just providing the signing certificate does not allow us to protect against the case where the same user has uploaded multiple images signed with the same cert

Good point. You are correct about having to provide the signature. We would need that because we not only need to verify the certificate but the hash as well. The downside about providing the signature is securing them. I don't know how to do that off-hand. I wish we had signed the hash of the image. Then the user could provide the certificate and the hash. The hashes could be stored in public and signed with an organization's private key along with the image name or something. I guess you could do the same with a signature blob it just seems a little less user friendly, and it is not as portable.

It is an idea I've considered, before deciding on the factory method. There are a couple of reasons I've preffered the factory method:

Indeed, base classes won't have to know about derived classes. But it is going to be harder to implement. Let's see how the checkers are currently initiated:

    - for every file defined in the conf.d folder, monasca-agent will load it's respective checker module. For cpu.yaml conf.d file, monasca-agent will load the cpu checker module.
    - for each loaded module, it will search for a subclass of AgentChecker via introspection.
    - if a subclass is found, an instance will be created:
        
                c = check_class(check_name, init_config=init_config,
                                agent_config=agent_config, instances=instances)

The problem with the current implementation, is that There's no guarantee which checker will be created (LinuxCpuChecker or Win32CpuChecker). Of course, the implementation can be changed to use the factory you've suggested, although, for simplicity, it will have to be renamed to a more generic name a bit:

    def get_checker(*args, **kwargs):
        if sys.platform == 'win32':
            return Win32CpuChecker(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            return LinuxCpuChecker(*args, **kwargs)

This way, when the checker is loaded, we should only look for the 'get_checker' function, instead of a AgentChecker subclass.

Now, the ugly part: This would mean I'd have to add 52 factories, one for each checker module. Most of them don't need any special implementation. Also, not sure if this is the case, if someone has some custom out-of-tree checkers, they won't have this factory, which means their checkers won't work.

Alternatively, when we create the checker object, we can look for the 'get_checker' function. If found, use it; if not, just use the old behaviour.

But, IMO, having a factory method was the simplest way to move forward. It allows us to have a default implementation for it: Load.factory returns a Load checker instance, Memory.factory returns a Memory checker instance, etc. 

We only needed to override the factory method when there are differerent implementations (process checker, cpu checker, etc.). The fact that it knows about its subclasses is the only negative side, which I don't see it as a big issue. It works fine.",False,22

However, the scope attachment here isn't about that duplication though, it's setting up a promise on the scope to notify the scope of us loading a new copy of the image from glance ... which is in turn listened to by a couple of controllers (edit-image and update-metadata). I don't like this at all, it's very spaghetti!

ISTM that the two controllers have a shared need for some data (a model) and that the actions service is kinda taking on a dependency resolution and notification role, which seems out of its core responsibilities. It just happened to be a convenient place to put stuff.

I believe that instances of ""$scope.imagePromise.then(init);"" should use angular's $modal dependency resolution (""resolve"") instead of us creating these complex interdependencies.

Reminder: what networking-bgpvpn currently does in br_tun is (a) insert an ARP responder rule to have our own special MAC be answered for the gateway, (b) traffic to this special MAC is derouted to br-mpls, (c) traffic from br-mpls is sent to br-int.

Reading this proposal, I was thinking that the networking-bgpvpn extension would stop inserting rule in existing tables, and would possibly add its own function/tables between existing tables of the current br_tun pipeline (see [1] for instance).

Is this the intent of the proposal ?

If yes, then I think that what would help would be to show br-int/br-tun (possibly br-phy as well), and their tables, in the pipeline description. Or perhaps (but that looks less nice) two ingress/egress diagrams, or for each bridge.

We would also need to name the current br_tun tables as function and have them appear in the ""Ordering of functional blocks defined in the manager,""

So, trying to understand the ingress path of BGPVPN:

  * what does br-mpls do
  * what traffic is sent to br-mpls

 - from a physical interface
 - and/or from a GRE tunnel interface
b) matches the MPLS label values to determine the destination VM (VM typically being a (vlan,mac) tuple)
c) after setting the destination MAC and adding a VLAN header, send the traffic to a patch port toward br-int
d) once in br-int the traffic will be delivered to the tap interface or qbr

By the way the motivations for doing all this in a separate bridge is because we started with a userspace component distinct from the agent to handle the BGPVPN functionality (bagpipe-bgp), so it's clean to follow this split in terms of OVS bridge ; it gives a clear responsibility boundary and it allow to develop/test the components independently.  bagpipe-bgp also happens to make a particular use of cookies (one cookie per-VPN to make it easy to clean state up).

This is a decision that has been made at one point in time, but which we may revisit in the future (running the BGPVPN functionality in an l2 agent extension).",False,22

The defined/declared functions, are just used by each specific extension, they are (unless for the common ones) just to serve the specific extension, and so we can order and chain them.

In the context of registers, you're right, that extensions could cooperate over some registers (specially the common ones).

And these private methods allow us to simplify the code. For example, without _get_group we would have to check whether the given group exists and raise an NoSuchGroupError if not. Same is for _get.

We can reach it by using public set_override method with enforce_type=True, but I don't like the idea of artificially overriding and then restoring values of options on each call of get.

Glance has given provision to sync database from the version(current_version) admin wants to.
We should not validate current_version with actual current db version because that condition
will not allow user to sync db from the version(current_version) he wants when creating database for 
the first time where current db version is 0(zero).

For ex:
Assume creating database for the first time where current db version is 0.
command: glance-manage db sync 47 5  #47=version to sync up to, 5=current_version to start from

If current_version > current_db_version: error
This condition will throw error and will not allow user to sync db from 5.

If no current_version is given by the user by default it takes 0 for current_version.",False,22

The number of devices processed under one compute node is greater than what is processed for drivers without cluster.

But for scheduler, going through each compute node and looking for matching pools is same as with or without a cluster. 

For example, without sub_node, if there are N hosts and M pools exposed to the scheduler. Then, it will have to go through each host and every pool in host to see if it matches the request.
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/pci/stats.py#L245

With sub_node, if there are N=N1+N2 hosts (say, N1 hosts under cluster 1 and N2 under cluster2), from scheduler point of view, it is exactly same number of hosts and pools to lookup for matching request i.e O(N*M)

Please let me know if I'm making any wrong assumptions.

One alternative I could think to avoid adding 'sub_node': 

in the vmware driver, query the esx hosts that has the allocated pci device while spawning an instance. But, when there are muliple SR-IOV devices requested for an instance, the problem with this approach would be that there is no guarantee pci manager would allocate devices from same ESX host. This is because pci manager would be unaware of sub_node/esx hosts. When sub_node is part of the pool keys, then we can allocated devices for an instance from same esx host.

None of the resources except SR-IOV require ESX host information to boot an instance. vcenter cluster would automatically select a host for other resource types. So, sub_node was never used before.",False,22

Either that or (possibly) dismiss the create modal once the image upload response gets back from glance and pop up an image upload modal with a progress bar and handle error messaging in it instead of using a toast.

http://imgur.com/qOTbytD

See above: When I kill glance API while this is running, the error messaging doesn't work quite right.  A toast in the background pops up, an odd error message shows up in the bottom left of the wizard (I think that's a known bug), an error shows up in the console (Error message below), and the progress bar remains stuck.

But on the plus side, I was able to restart the glance service and just click submit again for it work.

If you dismiss the modal, that would have the negative effect of losing your selections should it fail without the ability to try again. So, perhaps don't dismiss the modal.

I'm not sure of the total best UX here and would prefer to get something in than bikeshed forever, but would like to put this up for your consideration.

I've seen this pattern of specifying the kubernetes-endpoint within the kolla-kubernetes CLI tool as well.  I'm of the opinion that it is unnecessary, and adds confusion.  I was actually thinking about removing it from the CLI tool.

Reason is any of our automation, whether these ansible scripts or the CLI tool, should probably best use the currently set context that kubectl  is already configured to use.  You can check this with ""kubectl config current-context"" and ""kubectl cluster-info"".

The CLI tool ends up system-calling kubectl on the command line anyway.

Alright, let me know what you think, or if I'm missing the point.

Thanks!

This issue may be aside from the current pull request, but you seem to be refactoring all of this anyway so perhaps we should discuss this now.

Hopefully, there is room in the design for the ansible scripts to specify network volume mounts from different sources, depending on the provider.  Most importantly GKE disks, AWS EBS, and Ceph RBD volumes.

It would be great to integrate what I just mentioned into this POC.  Right now, bootstrapping and running Mariadb does not work well on multi-node kubernetes clusters, because there's no guarantee you will bootstrap and run on the same node.  I would prefer us to to show how that will work with this proof of concept.  I think it's core to support this from the start.

I believe you need a persistent volume claim for the cases when a stateful pod (such as mariadb) migrates from on Node to another.  If there is no persistent volume claim, then the volume cannot be re-used and all of the data needs to be re-synced at the new node.

We use persistent volume claims for our Elasticsearch cluster running within kubernetes.  When a node dies, the pod is migrated to a new node, and the same disk remains and is attached to the new node with the new pod.  Without this, recovery would take much time since all of the data would have to re-sync to the new node.

Overwriting images without fully cleaning the disk first runs into all sorts of issues of its own. Jay can delineate the cases better than I, but consider something like a RAID superblock. It leaves information about a RAID all over the disk, and just overwriting part of the disk with a new image won't necessarily destroy those superblocks, which could potentially cause weirdness if the new image's OS looks for them. I assume there are security implications lurking in here too.

We could update IPA to clean the disk after being interrupted during an imaging operation, but that could end up eating a lot of time on drives that don't have a fast secure erase option.

Arsenal handles the case of old images being 'updated' in Glance. That is, an image with the same name gets a new UUID causes cached images of that name with the old UUID to be sent through cleaning. Arsenal handles it by sending the node through cleaning. So my thinking is handling 'old' cached images falls under the perview of cache management, which I'm not proposing we add to Ironic.

Clif - I think we should either allow caching to be interrupted for a deploy request somehow (although I think on a previous patch set you mentioned this was quite difficult), or change it to a manual clean step. I'm not sure that an addition to the state machine would be necessary.

I can also imagine a situation where a deployer would want to enroll a set of machines, manage them and put images on them *before* they're available, and only then make them available. This is more easily handled without an addition to the state machine.

Also at present some backends (specifically LVM) create config disks on the compute node disk filesystem rather than on LVM.  In LVM case this is due to minimum file size issues.
So in the LVM case there will be two pools in use, the lvm pool and disk pool.

At present we effectively only support one backend type on a compute node but the imagebackend refactor and this work will aim to remove that restriction in terms of code implementation so in the future we could support different backend types per instance or even per disk.

Cold migration from older nodes would have to use the old mechanism since the code to support storage volume migration is not available.  This may work if the cloud operator has enabled ssh keys to support it and left the same enabled on the upgraded nodes but the files would be copied to the old style locations on the upgraded node.

Cold migration implies a shutdown instance so a start operation is required at some point.  When start is executed the upgraded node will detect the old style instance file layout and move files to the new layout creating storage volumes as required.

Thus we need separate pools for different backend types.  Max may be right that we can get away with using a disk type pool for ploop (as we can for other shared storage implementations like nfs that are invisible to the nova compute).  However, my analysis leads me to believe that for lvm and rbd we need a pool of the appropriate type. I'm happy to call them something else but not sure I see the point.  My thinking is that when a backend type is first used the appropriate pool will be created unless the backend implementation is such that the nova-disk-pool (a directory type pool mapped to <compute.instances_path>/_disks) covers it as with flat and qcow2 and maybe ploop too id Max is right. I was thinking that the backend type class would define the pool type to be used and pool name so a new pool of this type will be created using the configuration information applicable to that backend type when the backend was first used.

The cost is two-fold:
- designing & implementing this capability framework
- having the API leverage it

If the framework is mostly used by a client to do ""if feature X is available then do (something depending on X) else fail"", then I would argue that the value is reduced.

I would argue that such a framework would only add value for cases where the API client can choose an alternative solution if feature X happens to not be available: e.g. he could choose another driver having feature X, or it can choose to reach its goal by relying on another feature than feature X.  But I'm not sure these case are frequent enough.

The complexity of client-side automation/orchestration code leveraging these capabilities could end up being quite high. For instance think about a Heat template that would do A if feature X is available and B if not (with B being something else than 'fail').",False,22

My comment is mainly about the ntpinterfaces, because we're urrently afaics not setting that i.e. we have ./puppet/controller.yaml:1056: ntp::servers: {get_input: ntp_servers} for example but not for interfaces. So i was wondering about if we should explicitly set that to [] or just let the module default to what it wants. Now assuming we're using https://github.com/redhat-openstack/openstack-puppet-modules/blob/ab63b3886cf0b5e9bdb0a83322ba9b4af201dee3/ntp/manifests/params.pp#L23 then it is indeed '[]'.


[EDIT]: so in fact the case of the ntpservers turns out to be more interesting because current behaviour is we specify nothing at all and then it gets defaulted to something like https://github.com/redhat-openstack/openstack-puppet-modules/blob/ab63b3886cf0b5e9bdb0a83322ba9b4af201dee3/ntp/manifests/params.pp#L70 - my point is we should let the module default rather than explicitly setting [] in general and this is a good case of why",False,22

One major point worth raising is the ability for admins to customize the policy by which certain actions can be performed, which can invalidate the approach proposed in this spec because a change in policy may hide an expected capability thus making this whole thing more damaging than useful.

For copy from exportable snapshot (future) I'm not sure... What do Rodrigo and reviewers think?  Is it better to have a --snapshot flag that makes <source_id> switch from source_share to source_snapshot? Or, (I don't think we want) varying positional args for src/dest. Or, the other option would be a separate command for snap-source like:

usage: manila data-copy-snapshot [--source-path <source_path>]

My main concern about snapshot is that it is a different REST API, I don't like the idea of the python-manilaclient deciding to send to a different controller whether it is --snapshot or not, so I think we should be consistent and always send to the controller, or have ""data-copy-snapshot"", which I find to be a bit ugly.",False,22

Mistral's is a little more involved, being a pre vs post ack thing[2]. Barbican's, while not a custom dispatcher per-se, is using a different than default dispatcher with the (now) RPCServer class[3].

Allowing some or all of the Dispatcher class to be a API consumers of o.m can extend makes a bunch of sense to me, for example, say Designate wanted to start tracking all RPC calls with StatsD, the Dispatcher class is an obvious place to put this, but baking StatsD (or Ceilometer etc) right into oslo.messaging feels wrong..

Not being able to pass this dispatcher cls into this method means we just reimplement this entire method, which caused bug 1580139 when 5.0.0 was released, as the 3 projects didn't have this helper method to hide the underlying API changes.

Yes but not only queue gets cleaned up. Executor will continue processing end executing jobs. That was my idea - just continue working as it was before (when all BaseExceptions were caught).

interrupting queue is not a problem. because executor works with it in nonblocking manner (like get_nowait()). The problem is only in shutdown(wait=True) call where we wait for queue emptiness. It is not good just interrupt waiting there because its semantic is to wait for completion of all scheduled jobs, not just skipping (someone may wait for future result for example).

Strictly speaking, one might want to ps -o pgid= $! > service.pid rather than echo $! > service.pid
I kept echo $! > service.pid there as $! == $(ps -o pgid= $!) == $(ps -o pgid= ""$command"") in this case.

Also note that we don't know if the RPC call gets received by new or old c-vol service.

1. We're running with version pin set to 2.1.

* 2.1 version pin means all the c-vols are new and able to return object.
* We're guaranteed that everybody understands 2.1 so just receive and return an object - life is fine.

2. We're running with 2.0 version pin and request gets received by old c-vol (that understands only 2.0).

* We need to send request as 2.0 (old c-vol will fail on 2.1).
* Old c-vol returns a dict.
* Once we'll receive a dict we need to convert it to object (from_primitive) and return it as rest of our *new* code expects object.

3. We're running with 2.0 version pin and request gets received by new c-vol (that understands both 2.1 and 2.0).

* We send request as 2.0 (we don't know here that it will be received by new c-vol… okay, we could check, but it's easier to assume).
* c-vol before returning (in volume.manager) converts object to dict (to_primitive). Note that c-vol don't know if the request was made by someone understanding 2.1. It needs to obey and send 2.0 response (based on received context).
* We're receiving a dict, so similarly to 2. case we convert it to object (from_primitive).

Basically you keep the if here but instead of calling a different method according to the version if the version is less than the expected and the vm_state is RESCUED you raise the exception here, as the LM won't be supported.

The function name is confusing. 
In fact it is not related to retype.

The _retype_is_possible is called when creating a source volume from source volume or snapshot:

I looked into the whole logic of creating volume. And I think this function check is not needed. 

As during creating volume, the host of source volume and snapshot host will be given to the new volume, and then schedule.

Do we want a multiple stage pipeline, like what we have with graphics accelerators? For example, for ElasticSearch we would have an enrichment transformation that would be followed by an access control transformation. It would be nice (especially for the future) to make sure the architecture can support this.

It starts getting tricky when the transformations depend on both the plugin and the publisher. In this case, we would want the access control transformation to be included *only* if the ElasticSearch publisher is plugged in. This can be controlled with the config file, but that could be error prone. Having a publisher have a ""dependency list"" of transformations it requires could eliminate this problem. Assuming it's a problem :)",False,22

When the user creates a share with NFS,CIFS and then goes on to create replicas of that share, the replicas will have to have the same properties of the primary share; in case of 'dr' style of replication, non-active replicas have no export locations and access_rule updates are ignores on them.. I see no impact there...

In networks, depending on the network type (provider:physical_network attribute) of a particular network given by ID, additional parameters are accepted or rejected (provider:segmentation_id, provider:physical_network). In this settings, health check name is analogous to network ID (check name is unique for a given resource type in similarly as ID uniquely identifies a network), and the set of accepted parameters changes according to the nature of the check similarly to changing available parameters according to the nature of the network.

Set of available checks depends on particular installation, allowing for easy extension / change, according to user needs.

Please see also POC that provides illustration of all what is needed to register a new check in [1]. It also illustrates that there is no change in API. Applying the patch [1] is rather analogous to net-create command (following the analogy above) as it registers a new check with a unique name (with obvious differences that there are no changes in database and instead of ID, the check is available by its name).

Unless we have some kind of convention that our configtype internal values should always be non-unicode I think we should change line 592 to ""value = value.decode('ascii') if not isinstance(value, unicode)"" and then remove the decode from here.


Reasoning:
In IPAddress.__call__, value will be non-unicode for every case except when a default value with type unicode is specified in python (a non-unicode default value will pass through and our ConfigParser seems to always give us non-unicode). In the case where we got unicode as a default value I think we want to let it pass through (rather than try to encode it in ascii, which is what str(value) will do, and then decode it from utf-8). For the other cases we shouldn't need to support decoding non-ascii chars for an IP address, so decode('ascii') is reasonable.

The issue is more subtle than that. The QEMU 9p code is essentially unmaintained at this point. While it works ok in terms of what it aimed todo, it isn't that great, particularly its permissioning model - since QEMU runs as an isolated user account, QEMU can't write any files except those writable by the ""qemu"" user. It might be ok for read-only use cases, but pretty sucky as a general pupose passthrough solution. Because of these issues, and in general the lack of desire to maintain yet another guest filesystem driver, there's no 9p support in RHEL distros. So even if we added it to openstack, its pretty worthless for all these reasons.

The virtio-vsock approach is much more appealing because it requires no new guest filesystem to be supported (it'll just use NFS), the host filesystem backend is potentially separate from QEMU (so isn't restricted by QEMU process permissions) and since it doesn't require much code in QEMU, ongoing maint work is minimal compared to 9p.

The first question is about the naming--we have several options there (see below).  The second question (Tyr asked offline) is whether this route is useful as part of this patch.

There are three patches following on this one that set up Django panels: Images, Instances, and Volumes.  They are specifically setting up *panels*, not just Angular table views--this is important.  To function properly for upstream to accept, such panels need:
 a) Django navigation (exist in the left-nav hierarchy)
 b) Deep-linking (through Django, as all deep-linking has to be)
 c) Angular routing

""C"" is really easy; we set up a route however we want.  However, we are constrained by A and B.

""A"" requires that the path presented follow the navigational slug pattern; that is /project/instances uses the slugs 'project' and 'instance' to align with the panel enablement within Django/Horizon.  /project/list/something might work but I believe Django won't provide a way to get those slugs aligned with the nav structure.  So we could probably do something more like '/project/list-something' where 'list-something.'  In that case we'd have to register the slug in Django as 'list-something.'  That's fine, we just had been going down the route of 'ngimages' for Images, which is why I'd continued that approach.

""B"" basically just means that we use Django to resolve the path, which is accommodated by ""A"" above.  Note that this is different from the Details view, which doesn't have a navigational link; that is why Details is freed from the use of Django slugs; yet it still needs ""B"" for deep-linking.

If we neglect to provide these in a generalized fashion, each panel would end up doing the same things (A, B, and C) anyway; they still have to couple the slug with an Angular route, and use the same template, etc.  As a result, since three of the following patch chains require these features, it's much nicer to provide these as a generic route that all can use, the only price being registering a slug and ensuring it aligns properly with the slug in Django.  I think this is a key feature, not just a nice-to-have.

Finally, as a reminder for those interested in Searchlight, this patch has little to do with SL as we won't be linking to table views; the table views we'd provide in the search results would just use the hz-dynamic-table, not this view.  As a result, the whole purpose of this patch is to provide the ability for people to create Django *panels* easily that use the Angular views.",False,22

There is a routing problem to be concerned about. There are pages that cross link to each other and they have no way to know which panel is enabled.  I believe app catalog, and murano do this, but I know that Heat does:

https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/openstack_dashboard/dashboards/project/stacks/mappings.py

At the mitaka midcycle, we discussed that we'd need to register identical routes on the django and angular side to ensure routing works in a way that apps doing cross linking didn't have to know which panels were enabled.  However, afterwards, Richard and I came up with an alternative solution for containers:

I'm OK if we want to, but it will likely require a bit of context-switching for devs.

If having the kind of predetermined route as in this patch is too distracting, we can just make the routes individually as Tyr suggests for the panels as they're written.  Then each panel can decide what to do about its routing (e.g. do as swift did, or not) rather than having it forced on them.",False,22

As long as we are strictly dependent on elasticsearch, retrieving an existing document from elasticsearch can be part of the enrichment process. Ultimately we're hoping that notifications will contain all the data we need, though I'm getting less hopeful that'll ever be the case.

There are places where we currently index a partial document without first retrieving the existing indexed document, and that'll cause problems although we can work around that.

For instance, if missing security group rule is the issue, everything might be setup correctly from perspective of all neutron health checks validating individual resources. Port as well as network and floating IP would be ""healthy"". In such a situation, the information on which of the network segments is blocking the ping is at least helpful. Without simple 'ping' action, the user is left with the almost same situation as without diagnostics - everything seems to be correctly set up individually but the the components do not work together.

Hence a health check is necessary that checks whether port/floating IP is reachable from another port (within Neutron managed resources). Indeed it can be renamed from ""ping"" to e.g. ""reach"" but the technical reasoning remains unchanged.

I am not suggesting not to use it. All I am suggesting is that the reachability check (whether performed via ping or not) is embedded in the reachability test procedure and only the outcome is exposed to the user, e.g. the reachability test is failed.

If a user is concerned with connectivity of a floating IP there are multiple reachability tests that must be performed along all the segments that make up the path to get to the destination (like you show in figure 2), I don't believe the user should proactively perform the tests himself/herself, or exposed to the underlying results.

To the end user, this would be indeed transparent. From that perspective, even Alternative 1 would come ""batteries included"" provided there will be an implementation of a ""reachability test"" included.

Furthermore, Alternative 1 would also be immediately useful to operators as it would allow them to use exposed elementary checks from a openstack client, removing the need to determine the affected host, log in there, and remotely execute respective shell commands. New checks would be also available in neutron server sooner for use as in Alternative 2, apart from the elementary check implementation that is common to both alternatives, a new check needs to be incorporated into troubleshooting (aggregation check) before it can be used.

It seems that we are on the same page regarding the result: also this spec views health status as a composite property where individual checks (that are selected by the user/troubleshooting tool) return error code, description and details.

Where we differ is that details should be placed into ""details"" field (according to your suggestion) or structured into attributes in the returned result. This can be overcome by placing the structured result fields into details property, e.g.:

Re stdout/stderr: I understand the concerns and the original intent was to allow only operators to execute the checks exactly for this reason. I agree that if the ordinary users should be able to execute the checks too, sensitive information could be given away here. Hence I will omit these fields from the first iteration.


Ad combined resources: 


So far there have been the following distinct cases of port health procedures mentioned in the comments:

1. /ports/{id}/health
2. /ports/{id}/health with parameter port_id=X
3. /ports/{id}/health with parameter floating_ip_id=Y

Each of the checks tests a different scenario:

1. Tests whether a particular port {id} interface exists,  is up etc.
2. Tests reachability of a port X from port {id}
3. Tests reachability of a floating IP from port {id}

There are two options to handle these:

* (a) Depending on the given parameters, the health ""controller"" executes only those checks that are fully parameterized by given parameters
* (b) Assign each scenario a name and request the user to specify which check they want to run by specifying the check name along with all parameters requested by the check.

The options lead to the following tests:

* (a) Means that 2 always tests everything what 1 does, and similarly 3 always tests everything what 1 does, because 1 needs no parameters and would be hence executed always
* (b) Means that 1, 2, and 3 test only the chosen scenarios.

I prefer option (b) for there is clear predictability on which scenario is tested and hence which parameters are necessary to put in. It has also benefit of preventing execution of unnecessary checks (those that do not need parameters or can run with a proper subset of the given parameters).

The other would be passed in as a parameter (be it query string in GET or content body in POST method). I miss to understand the reason why passing parameters should create a security vulnerability.

The only concern from the security point of view is how the parameters are checked to prevent execution of malformed requests (buffer overflow, correct JSON syntax and similar vulnerabilities up to the point of accepting request and invoking the controller code are out of scope of this spec and should be handled in HTTP serving code). Special care needs to be taken to reject bad requests (e.g. invalid  parameter values), and only the parameters required to execute the health check should be used to propagate into relevant check logic. The controller that executes the health checks (passing in the arguments obtained from HTTP request) must consult the only authoritative source of the set of available parameters and their formats for the executed health check - that is the health check itself.

Hence the question should be raised not about whether to allow parameters, but about the actual set of allowed parameters and their expected formats for every and each health check.",False,22

Because neutron cluster might be in an error state, e.g. a discrepancy of versions on controller node and the network node due to unsuccessful update on network node where plugin would expect agent to have some check defined that is not there.

 Client --(1)--> API --(2)--> Plugin --(3)--> Driver --(4)--> Agent

Result is returned in the reverse direction.

In this example, let's assume that a port is to be diagnosed:

(1) Client invokes a request to /v2/ports/{id}/health.
(2) API health controller checks whether a health check is registered for a port resource. If not, it rejects request, otherwise if given parameters fulfil the constraints set by the check, it invokes the health check execution in plugin.
(3) Plugin executes the plugin part of the health check. If the check is provided by a driver, it delegates the check execution to the driver, otherwise the check can directly execute and return result.
(4) Driver part of the check determines which agent should be responsible for execution and using RPC, it invokes agent part of the check.

This is how the call should proceed if it actually propagates to the agent level. The nature of the check might such that it is implemented in driver or even plugin, then it would return sooner.

For example, if ML2 is plugin, the driver might be mechanism driver (openvswitch) and agent would be ovs_neutron_agent. Port health would require checkint that a port exists and is up. Both of these checks can only be performed at node where the port is bound, hence all of the components (plugin, driver, agent) would be called for such a check.",False,22

   * decide to move it into the main kolla repo

So to handle this duplicate items, we've improved and added additional modules like puppet-openstacklib, puppet-oslo and puppet-openstack_rspec_helper where we pull in these shared items so they can be managed individually. Additionally we manage the puppet-openstack-integration which is where all of our integration test cases can be managed in a single location.  We also use cookiecutter for new modules and modulesync to do batch operations across the projects.  This concept can be extended to kolla and would probably make it easier to manage in the longer term allowing individuals to specialize in specific containers or allowing new projects to help bootstrap their container process. Much like we've seen with the recent addition of the vitrage, congress, barbican puppet modules.  There's some advantage to forcing this separation because it also makes people think how can things be reused where today it might get buried in a single repo and forces people to think about how they integration with the other pieces.  It also allows much simpler overriding of a single item. So if i want to use upstream for projects W,X,Y,Z today and then need to replace Y with my own custom one, I can simply use a different source repo and continue.

If you support your own container X that is based on our base image, which would be the way to do it, when we change our base image you might run into problems. Rather than that we provide integrated customization mechanism which should work for majority of use cases.

If the health extension is going to have a list of the checks from start-up time, is it worth considering just exposing the list of checks on collections/resource so consumers can at least get a list of check names? e.g. GET /v2/{collection}/health would return a list of health check names for the collection.

If even that is out of scope, I guess I'm looking for this doc to saying something like ""Check authors should document their checks by using the doc impact tag on their patch sets"", or something along those lines.

I'm not sure it is.  My unclearly stated point here is that this thing: 'CONF.image_format.container_formats' represents all the formats in use in this particular cloud; as that's NOT what we want to list here in the ""discovery"" output, we need a new configuration option to pull the appropriate info from.

> What tells the formats accepted for import into Glance?

The new configuration option I'm talking about would do that.

Some large OpenStack public cloud, for example, might accept only source_container_format == 'bare' but might actually store images as 'ova' (and maybe some other container formats).

In case of ""resize"" disk_gb is calculated based on the new_instance_type (flavor) at [1].
As instance.root_gb is updated to zero at API level in case of volume backed instance so this change will reflect the same value for new_instance_type.

As of now this is the best available way to fix this issue, Any suggestions are welcome.

(typo? max_upload_bytes->max_upload_time')

I understand the 'why' of max_upload_time. (Wouldn't it be nice to drop connections/return 400 when we hit a time limit.)

What I'm not clear on is the 'how'. For example, is this something that we intend to happen in the glance code in some way? If so, how?

Doug: But there would be no way for deployers to add other methods so clients would only have to deal with the 2 methods. Is that still the plan?

dt: That is my plan, the user sees two variants, where 'swift-local' is a special-case of indirect ('copy-from').  Signalling the available scope of indirect is the point of the above comment.  I really want OSC to only have two choices: --filename|--location for the user to specify the source of the bits to be imported.  (yeah, there may be additional blanks to fill in, but those two will be the switch).  And if I cared to parse URIs, supporting file:// would work too, but that's not quite as user-friendly.

-----
Morgan: My concern/confusion is this looks like it is not going towards ""2 methods"" but ""2 methods and pluggable for anything else""

dt: I want that to be phrased ""2 methods where one (indirect) may have vendor-specific characteristics"" if there must be value-add options here.   Indirect can be a single method (from the user POV) if all of the desired ""plugging"" is handled in the URI: swift://, vmware://, https://, gopher://, etc  After all, that's why URIs have schemes...and users smart enough to upload images get that.

-----
Nikhil: Like I mentioned above, the feedback from security team has been that `copy-from-url` cannot be considered as a standard practice as it has assumptions around the setup of network, access permissions to the url, scrutiny of data flowing through the wires, etc. So, we would like to avoid the `copy-from-url` case to not be part of the RefStack tests. It needs to be supported by operators who intend to expose it for use case like that of ""pulling an image from apps.openstack.org""

dt: I need to go read all of that security feedback for full context, at first reading, the major difference between direct and indirect to me is the network access required for the Glance process to fetch an indirect URL.  'copy-fron' appears to assume full Internet access, 'swift-local' appears to only assume Swift endpoints, which may be completely internal to the cloud deployment (risk of some internal exposure there!) and of course direct is receive-only from the server standpoint.  All of the other risk factors appear to be common for all import methods.  Oh, one other difference: for direct you have only the credentials used for the user as audit for 'who did this', for indirect you also have the source URL, both of which may be compromised in worst-case.
-----

Ideally there will be no scheme-specific (swift/vmware/whatever) bits in the clients to deal with those implementations.

No, user will not have implementation details of how this would work. I am advocating that user will have to know what the available way to import is in a particular cloud, that will be returned as a response via this import_methods call.

I asked a bunch of people at the summit and the response was that as long as RefStack tests pass you don't have an interop issue. If a site supports either `glance-direct` or `swift-local` , you will not have an interop issue as that's what the RefStack tests should test and they will pass for the clouds.

The way we look at it, the RefStack list is defined as ['glance-direct`, `swift-local`]. We are going to accept additional implementation of the upload mechanism (which is a deal breaker for some clouds) (and also supports feature parity with v1) (and was asked by many operators during the v1 deprecation session) is `copy-from-url` where a user is expected to provide a http(s) url to import the data from a remote (sometimes non-trusted data source). 

As there are many deployment specific assumptions -- say you only allow internal http(s) locations, or you only allow https locations, etc, this needs to be a non-DefCore (non-RefStack) implementation of the upload/data-copy mechanism. What that means is, it should be a choice of an operator if they intend to support it based on the security, performance etc assumptions.

I was hinted at the request to support may be a vmware specific location for those deployments to help speed-en snapshots.

Where will the implementations live? -- all upstream. 

What are the plugins (I really really want us to avoid using this term, more so because I want to avoid working on another hour long response, something that's not professionally healthy.) -- a set of scripts that operator can run on image data that has already been uploaded to the staging area (example [2]). The scripts will run on the image data itself and will be opaque from user's POV. Also, tasks need to be configurable as a image introspection/conversion on one cloud can be totally different from that on the other. (These set of operations are opaque to the user.)

Can this be done? I do not see a reason why not. I followed the blog from Mark [1] to see if it is OK.

From what I described above, you tell me if we are exposing implementation details and why so?

I think we will work with openstackclient (not sure about others) to support other provisioning like copy-from. Since operators will only be able to use what is upstream, we will have a provisioning with client with that update. As of now, we only have been given 3 strong use cases -- `glance-direct` , `swift-local` , `copy-from-url` with the first and the third being more popular with small scale clouds and second being preferable with large scale one.

As far as, which methods would be activated is concerned -- I think if we are giving a choice on `glance-direct` or `swift-local` then only one of those needs to be activated at a site for the tests to pass. I would assume operators who are worried about their public facing endpoint being subject to attacks, the `glance-direct` would be switched off.

Or did I misunderstand?

I had clearly communicated the requirement of a `copy-from-url` use case on the import spec. 

Please take a look at comment on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/232371/ with the following search attributes you can use to find that comment. Also a response from Flavio on the same PS indicating the accommodation of that use case:

---

Having said that, irrespective of the implementation the APIs will be upstream. Hence, they will have info for the client to know the expected requests/responses.

The optional attributes are well defined as well, as the current proposal is for the three use-cases.

I do not see a reason why, if we need to support a vmware specific url to pull the data from data source, we can't do it without letting the client know of the expected request/responses.

Even if the support is for more than `glance-direct` or `swift-local`, DefCore capabilities will require all clouds to expose either of the above two to get the branding approved so they will always be available (in interop clouds) to ensure clients work successfully.

---

Let me know if I've missed anything. I'd really like to avoid repeating the same arguments again. So, if the intent isn't clear even now, we need to setup a hangout of air or likes of it, for a conversation that can be recorded and be made publicly available.

Also, I am confused by some of your comments on how Ironic creates 'trunk ports'. Neutron's ability to model a trunk over multiple Neutron logical networks is such that the following workflow be possible:

 neutron net-create Na; neutron create-port Na # get Pa
 neutron net-create Nb; neutron create-port Nb # get Pb
 neutron net-create Nc; neutron create-port Nc # get Pc

 neutron trunk-create --parent Pa --sub-port Pb --sub-port Pc

 nova boot --flavor X --image Y --nic port-id=Pa

So I don't see how/when Ironic is involved in Neutron's port creation. Bear in mind that booting specifying a network is not something we have considered, knowing that other classes of boot examples that require the specification of port id (e.g. sriov).",False,22

If I do: 

neutron net-create Na; neutron create-port Na # get Pa
neutron net-create Nb; neutron create-port Nb # get Pb

nova boot --nic port-id=Pa --nic port-id=Pb

or

nova boot --nic net-id=Na --nic net-id=Nb

Currently its completely dependant on which server the nova scheduler lands the instance on whether or not the nova boot will succeed. If it was placed on to the server with only 1 nic then a user would receive the error: ""Ironic node: <uuid> virtual to physical interface count missmatch"". This sort of inconsistency doesn't happen with VMs because it can dynamically create the ports for the VM on the fly.

What I am suggesting is that at the point that would happen in the current implementation, we instead notice that a user has requested more virtual ports than they have physical ports available, and then create 1 or more neutron trunk ports for them to provide the requested connectivity over the available physical nics, so that it doesn't fail, and their requested connectivity is provided.

This still leaves the problem of what if a tenant does:

neutron net-create Na; neutron create-port Na # get Pa
neutron net-create Nb; neutron create-port Nb # get Pb
neutron net-create Nc; neutron create-port Nc # get Pc
neutron net-create Nd; neutron create-port Nc # get Pd

neutron trunk-create --parent Pa --sub-port Pb
neutron trunk-create --parent Pc --sub-port Pd

nova boot --nic port-id=Pa --nic port-id=Pc

at this point the requested ports are already trunk ports, unless we could merge them into a single trunk port in some way, then if the schedular lands it on the server with only 1 nic then we'd still have to fail with a mismatch.",False,22

- BM connects directly to a switch, so there is no possibility for a translation service between the vlan output of a node and the real neutron segmentation ID as described in the spec.

- Users doing a nova boot would still get a different experience between
BM and VM:
2 physical ports means that nova boot would still have to throw an error if the user requested more than 2 --nic net-ids, and would be forced to manually set up a neutron trunk port, if they required any more connectivity which they wouldn't have to do for a VM. 

BM to BM:
The problem here is that every BM could be different, e.g. some might have 1 nic some might have 2, some might have 5. and depending on which the scheduler lands the instance onto could force the users nova boot to pass or fail.

The concept I've proposed in one of our recent neutron-ironic meetings that I hope to discuss in Austin so I can rework this whole spec, is a model based on this spec which uses the VLAN aware VMs neutron APIs/Models:

As a user I can request as many ports as I want, and nova will still create N neutron ports for me, and then Ironic handles the neutron port to physical port mapping, dynamically creating trunk ports in neutron when required, and not creating them if not required. This means that the nova boot experience will be consistent no matter which BM node the scheduler lands the instance on. (If the user nova boots with more than one trunk port then we may still have to apply limits based on the available physical nics, unless we allow merging of trunk ports or something similar) 

This solves the nova boot consistency issue however it doesn't solve the compatibility problems with the current proposed API, e.g. that we are unable to support having a different segmentation_id and type to the neutron port the subport represents.

I believe this problem isn't unique to baremetal, and will present itself for some network implementations that don't use a virtual switch for VMs and provide direct switch to VM connectivity such as SRIOV. It may be that we just have to either ignore those parameters on the subport (although that maybe lead to unexpected results from the users perspective) or force them to match the actual neutron ports segmentation id/type, if that type is SRIOV or Baremetal etc. and disallow a user from modifying them via the API for those types.",False,22

Only when it times out! That's the point.
Kevin's patch is an initial solution to the blueprint you suggested earlier, it's mentioned in the RFE as well. It's so that the client does not overwhelm the server with more and more requests. So in a way batching is advantageous here.

>> much slower than an agent without the batch RPC thing...
Not exactly, IMHO we get this feeling, because the tests didn't emulate such a busy condition on the server. If the server is busy, then each of these small size chunk calls will take more time to come back, some may even fail with timeout!

That's why I tend to not agree on synthetic timing/call calculations.

>>  It would make the whole thing rather slower.
Not necessarily.

Now imagine, that the server is moderately loaded, and still we are getting this issue consistently with port size beyond a certain threshold. I assume this is rare, and the bug here is not hitting such a scenario, but let's consider this case as well.
In this case the server is unable to enumerate all the details of all the ports requested in the timeout requested, and the client times out before the server had finished.
Now there are two solutions to this rare case (rarity, I am assuming, because I don't have the resources to test and validate it :-))

1) Provide a higher timeout value.
In this case Kevin's patch won't provide the adaptive timeout, but then the caller would have to adapt the timeout to the input size, or decide upon a large static timeout upfront (which is not good!)

2) Config based chunk size
Here too, we need to decide upon this chunk size upfront based on the server's threshold, which is again heavily based on the env (nw, hw, etc.). This is also not ideal IMHO.

3) Adaptive size & timeout

Now in this scenario we are assuming that the server is not timing out due to its load, but rather due to its inability to scale up to the input size. If that's the case, then it will fail each time it's called, and may end up taking more time each time (with batch RPC)! One solution would be to cache the last size that worked (adaptive case), and try with that the next time. But since I assume this is not the real cause of the bug, I felt there is no need to add it. But it's not a pain to include that as well along with adaptive chunk size.

If Kevin's BP is going to address this issue with push notifications/RPC call backs, then we can drop both the patches.

>> I assumed constant overhead per rpc call.
IMHO, you shouldn't assume that.

Also you haven't considered the operations on the server side, or the state of the server! It is when you consider these variance, that the issue with static config values arise!

I believe this is a trade off situation. There is an advantage to do network calls in a group, but it's true only till a range. Beyond that threshold, the input size, and the server limit is not letting the client get a timely response. So we've to try dynamically adjusting it for a fixed amount of time. If it's still not responding after a certain no of tries with adjusted size (specific to each call) and timeout, we've to bail out!

Like, if the size is 1500 and if the server can handle it, there is no point in doing it in 15 chunks. So grouping benefits here... But if you are grouping 15000, and cannot get a timely response, then grouping fails. There too, why do we need to do it 150 times?
 Try halving and check... and come down exponentially.

This way you get the benefit as described by your call saving formula >= (1 - 1/N). '+' We get the benefit of grouping as well.

Thanks for the reply.

I'm going to develop irmc driver which set iscsi and fc setting via OOB for cinder integration.

Could we, ilo and irmc, could share the code for the L.69-73 portion in deploy()?

I thought we could if we move the deploy() to a new common class.

The below properties are not on the image.properties location because horizon legacy python code is using the v1 images API (deprecated) and the searchlight index is index with the images v2 API.  So, when opening the action, it is angry:

http://pasteboard.co/2I9jyGwL.png

This goes back to the conversation we've had about using IDs and always getting latest from API vs just accepting the input object.  In this case, the issue is that the v1 api puts things on image.properties and v2 directly puts them on the image. 

But, i'm thinking that if an action is dependent on a certain object representation and API version that we'd be safer taking the ID as input and the action fetching the object fresh.

I guess I have a hard time understanding how this is simpler, unless you assume that all potential groups of target hosts are already in defined aggregates, which is highly unlikely. Because here is the process:

1) you decide to live migrate a VM.
2) you determine the acceptable host(s)

Now if you want to use aggregates: 

2a) you create the aggregate
2b) for every host:
2bb)    add the host to the aggregate

Note that if you have, say, 10 hosts, that would involve 11 additional API calls.

3) Call live migration, passing either a) list of hosts or b) aggregate

4) Verify that the migration succeeded

Again for aggregates:
4a) for every host:
4aa)   remove host from aggregate
4b) delete aggregate

So, for the case of 10 hosts, you have to make 22 additional API calls. In general, for N hosts you will have to make (N*2)+2 more API calls.

issue 2. **Sometimes** the NLA order matters.

There is no common netlink code in the kernel that would enforce NLA uniqueness, so one RTNL parts may provide it, while other may not. Thus the pyroute2 parser, being generic, returns NLAs as a chain (list), not as a dict. The `IPRoute` class doesn't touch messages and returns them as is.

If you wish, I can provide a wrapper with the same API as `IPRoute`, but that will return messages with NLAs as an ordered dict (to save the order, see issue 2), not as a list. That's easy from the library's perspective.

This isn't an issue as long as the subsequent IP command they try to run would fail with the same error of the namespace not existing.

On thinking about this further, I suspect that the connection this will hold to the namespace will actually prevent the namespace from being deleted. For example, if this is holding a connection and I run 'ip netns delete namespace', will that just remove the link to the descriptor in the /var/run/netns directory and actually leave the namespace hiding in invisbility until the agent is restarted and '.close()' is called on all of these?",False,22

0 would mean that a failure from either get_version() or checking of get_info() for normal mode would return false, but not necessarily immediately, could still take a number of seconds.

The only real way to be absolutely sure that you only wait the exact number of seconds would be to spin off a separate process to check, looping here and terminating it should it fail to return success. But I think that's a little overkill for scenarios where someone set a 5 second connection timeout via __init__ and then complains that waiting for jenkins to be up doesn't return in less time than that.

 * __init__ timeout: control connection timeouts
 * wait_for_normal_op: absolute timeout to wait for multiple connections to connect.

As this is an API, we should allow the consumer to control both options, and to respect them, presumably even if they could cause something stupid to happen.

I don't think we should ever explicitly reset the timeout to _GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, since that actually means by default to never timeout, or rather default to the system connection timeout which AFAIK is 15 minutes for TCP. Assuming you didn't get connection refused but rather just no response.


The questions remaining:

If someone using this API doesn't set the timeout when creating the jenkins object, is it correct to override the default timeout? What would be an appropriate value? I guess the total time of the passed timeout to this method might be most correct? If you can't connect within that time, should return false anyway.

If the API user puts in a bad value (what if they explicitly set _GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT), should we correct them or just warn them that it might be a bad idea?

Currently leaning towards just warning them instead of trying to correct them as I feel API's should warn about possible bad consequences, while it's more an application's job to prevent bad consequences.

In this case, we need to ensure that the VM on the compute node which we *think* is dead (but cannot be sure, because we didn't fence it) can no longer write to the shared storage.  

IOW, it's like the diagram here:

http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html#making-the-lock-safe-with-fencing

I can't imagine how you'd use fencing tokens to ensure that, because it would require every single I/O op from the hypervisor to the storage to go through an extra layer which used fencing tokens, and that sounds extremely complicated, ugly, and likely to have a big impact on I/O performance.  Or am I misunderstanding something?

Either way, if you are suggesting this kind of approach, it would be helpful to include links to relevant pages, e.g.

 > tl;dr: This will cause a lot of scheduling failures for instances with NUMA topologies.
 > AFAICT, this is going to cause a lot of heartache for folks using NUMA. NUMA topologies can be enabled in the guest both implicitly (attaching hugepages) and explicitly (image metadata or flavor extra specs). When using a NUMA topology with a PCI/SR-IOV device attached, your vCPU processes are affinitized to the node that said device is associated with. Attempting to attach a second device associated with a different node _without_ specifying a multi-node NUMA topology will result in a scheduling failure. This is a tricky, but rare, corner case right now, however, I imagine the system you're proposing will make occurrences of this issue far more common. I think you need to address this issue here lest before it becomes a bigger one during development.

For example, if its thin provisioned for a volume 10G and we've written 1G, going off the description here http://docs.ceph.com/docs/jewel/rbd/librbdpy/#rbd.Image.diff_iterate it looks like our check of ' if exists:' means if data is written, then the length of that is what we are adding to _total_usage would be that 1G of data written... maybe.. ? 


At a quick glance through that doc page I think we might actually just want v.size() for provisioned_capacity_gb, and then for free_capacity_gb it would be the thing we calculate as _total_usage subtracted from total_capacity_gb. So like the total amount of actual free space left on the backend. Im fairly sure that leaving free_capacity_gb and total_capacity_gb as unknown make all of this kind of moot anyway, the scheduler won't care about what numbers you give for the ratio or anything https://github.com/openstack/cinder/blob/master/cinder/scheduler/filters/capacity_filter.py#L50-L68

We could probably just report thin_provisioning_support: True and call it a day if we don't need to (or don't have a way to) report free/available space :D


I looked through the scheduler log http://logs.openstack.org/62/178262/6/check/gate-tempest-dsvm-full-devstack-plugin-ceph/dae930f/logs/screen-c-sch.txt.gz and only ever see provisioned_capacity_gb as being 0.0, so nothing to indicate one way or the other what its doing.

AFAICT, this is going to cause a lot of heartache for folks using NUMA. NUMA topologies can be enabled in the guest both implicitly (attaching hugepages) and explicitly (image metadata or flavor extra specs). When using a NUMA topology with a PCI/SR-IOV device attached, your vCPU processes are affinitized to the node that said device is associated with. Attempting to attach a second device associated with a different node _without_ specifying a multi-node NUMA topology will result in a scheduling failure. This is a tricky, but rare, corner case right now, however, I imagine the system you're proposing will make occurrences of this issue far more common. I think you need to address this issue here lest before it becomes a bigger one during development.

NOTE: I recently documented this behavior [1], if you want to see official documentation on the issue (see 'Customizing instance NUMA topologies', second warning).

All of this change is fine with me conceptually, but I'm not convinced there's a specific gain to imposing yet another directory refactor.  The cost is high because it intrudes upon every namespace within the module, and yet the change is functionally equivalent--you don't get anything except an organizational gain, which I feel is marginal.  I don't want churn while we're trying to get the framework stuff through (which is independent of this question).  There is not a specific harm to what we have; we can keep adding resources in here within Horizon, with all resources we've identified, and that wouldn't cause issues.

The idea is that somebody (e.g. cloud operator/deployer) can run these tests from outside of the cloud to verify Heat installation. If we set some default for this list (tests that we currently know are not working in such case) then those will be skipped on our gates too, so that we still need a variable to indicate that the test run is external. If we do not set any default, than the user who starts the tests run must have knowledge of which tests are not working, which is suboptimal too.

How about I leave this option and add the list of known failing when run externally tests as another option? This way the list of non-working will be explicit, and still there is control whether to skip them or not.

I will look for a different name to eliminate the overlap though.

There should be some way in the templates themselves to specify that a variable is private and not intended for use by the caller of the template.  We need that information to avoid presenting things to the user that they shouldn't know/care about.

Whether that should block this entirely is a separate discussion I guess.  I think it's worth noting that we'd need to come up with a list of such private parameters in any case, and if there's a convenient list already here when we go to update the parameter definitions themselves after we figure out how that should be represented, it's not the worst thing in the world.",False,22

Two I think we've identified here:

1. Allow descriptions in environment files

2. Way to classify parameter as private/internal

I think the second one could be achieved via a ""private"" parameter group, which wouldn't need any heat changes, but it would add a bit of additional code to the templates, we might consider refining that interface in heat e.g so you can just do group: private instead of having to refer to the parameter in a parameter_groups definition.",False,22

I agree the format you suggested looks more neat and clear. But this format has be used by neutron CLIs, for example:
port-create  --allowed-address-pair ip_address=IP_ADDR[,mac_address=MAC_ADDR] --fixed-ip subnet_id=SUBNET,ip_address=IP_ADDR

router-update --route destination=CIDR,nexthop=IP_ADDR

If I have two hosts, host-a and host-b, each with a DHCP agent. If two subnets are added to one network (which is not hosted by any dhcp agents yet) concurrently, then there is a chance that this network will be hosted by two dhcp agents, even if agents_per_network is set to 1. This is because the bindings_to_add validation check will valid for both requests, due to the fact that two requests happen at the same time and the network is not hosted by any agent at that time. Then both agents (from host-a and host-b) will be sent to bind(). The root cause is the ""check number of agents per network"" action and ""bind agents to network"" action do not happen in an atomic manner. 

The fix I proposed here does a post clean up. After every agent is bound to a network, we check the number of agents hosting this network. If the number exceeds the configured number, we do a clean-up. As per Kevin's advice, the clean-up happen in concurrent requests as well, thus we need to find a way to avoid two requests deleting different dhcp agents and leaving the network with fewer agents than expected. So I add a sort by UUID to make sure the to-be-deleted agent in two requests is the same.

This section need to be re-considered.

I didn't figure out any good solution to detect this kind of error configuration.
1. Because there may have multiple l3 agent with different config file, it can not detect this error on neutron server side.
2. If we want to detect this error on l3 agent side, we need pass network provide information to l3 agent, and we need to detect whether that ml2 agent type is ovs agent, then do the config check. It looks very strange to pass network provide information to l3 agent, and ""external_network_bridge"" will be deprecated. 
So I suggest to ignore this issue, but add warning in l3_agent.ini file.

What your suggestion?

Well, first of all, a good chunk of those capabilities are requested via image metadata properties, which are standardized and object-ized. So, this already requires Nova code change and one cycle before it can be used.

For flavor extra_spec, I wouldn't be surprised if one day it will become an object as well. It seems that the general direction of Nova is towards standardization and objectifying everything.

Secondly, in order for a compute node to report that new capability, it will require some Nova code change (e.g.: check if it's available, set the appropriate value(s) to the right field in the HostCapabilities object).

Plus, in order to actually use that capability, it will probably require some code written in one of the drivers.

Thirdly, for each capability you have define something like a matching rule for the scheduler: when can you consider that a host X can satisfy a requested capability ``foo``?

Also, some Nova cores will probably dislike the idea of having compute nodes reporting bizzare capabilities that they don't know anything about.
