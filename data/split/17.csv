Doing a directory isn't needed for extras files - we parse requirements files ourselves *anyway*.

I propose instead:
 - requirements.txt remains as-is.
 - add a new file extras.txt
 - use ini section headers in it to identify extras
 -reflect that into extra_requirements automatically.

I don't know well third party modules, but I can say that they are modules in the Python standard library which are *not* thread safe. For example, the subprocess module is not thread-safe, especially in Python < 3.2.
http://bugs.python.org/issue19809

I wrote a list of modules which are not thread-safe somewhere in the asyncio or the threads spec, but I'm unable to find the comment :-(

Other recent examples from the Python bug tracker.

- zipfile is no thread-safe in python < 3.5: http://bugs.python.org/issue14099
- fnmatch is not thread-safe in python < 3.5: http://bugs.python.org/issue23191

There is also the generic issue with C libraries calling directly fork() and the problem of inherited file descriptors with multiple threads. This issue is now fixed in Python 3.4:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0446/
(I recently fixed a bug in nova, it came from libguestfs which calls fork() to run qemu in a subprocess. it was already fixed in more recent version of libguestfs which closes all file descriptors after fork, which is the right fix.)

Many bugs have been fixed in the threading module, even recently. Last example, there was a race condition in the function generating an unique name for threads: http://bugs.python.org/issue11866. Other threads bugs:

- threads.RLock doesn't handle signals correctly in Python < 3.2: http://bugs.python.org/issue13697

In my experience, bugs related to threads are the most complex :-( For example, it took me 6 months with the help of colleagues to discover this annoying bug:
http://bugs.python.org/issue14432
(It's now fixed in Python 2.7.7)

Well, as usually, the latest stable Python version has less bugs :-) So using threads in Python 3.4 is safer than using threads in Python 2.7.

I'm not trying that it's impossible to write safe code with threads in Python. I just want to warn you that there are many traps and that you must be more/very careful to avoid them :-)

If you don't run your whole application in threads, but only small functions, it's easier to check if the code executed in threads is thread-safe. If I understand correctly this spec, a large part of OpenStack will run concurrently in threads. So code requiring to be thread-safe become almost all OpenStack code base and all third-party modules, right?",False,17

as for stack-delete being special - sorry, my fault, everything is right, args.id is a list already.

but there is another problem here, as you are right, currently we can not filter on stack_id, and some commands (like delete and actions) do not return a stack object that can be examined for the stack name.

So I suggest the following solution:
instead of stacks.list() just obtain a stack object by making stacks.get(args.id) call (or several calls for the case of the delete, but better make them with some delay to not accidentally trip on OverLimit, may be use another function for that similar to what is done in the list) and pass that to the print_list as you are already doing.

Or, of course, you could implement filtering on stack_id on server side :) and wisely construct the filter argument to the stacks.list() based on what to filter on, name or id. or make the filtering on name actually also understand ids.",False,17

Take a look how --filters argument is processed in do_stack_list, you can construct similar argument to hc.stacks.list() here. As all the operations in question are necessarily tenant-scoped, and we enforce a unique stack name in the tenant, filtering on a given stack name should do the job fine.

Creating multiple workers like this will result to have all workers that share the same identity. This is usually because the 'server' is set with the 'hostname', to make our life easier.

With rabbitmq for example, the 'server' attribute of the oslo.messaging.Target is used for a queue name, you usually have the following queues created:

    scheduler
    scheduler.scheduler-node-1
    scheduler.scheduler-node-2
    scheduler.scheduler-node-3
    ...

Keep things as-is will result that messages that go to scheduler.scheduler-node-1 will be processed randomly by the first ready worker. You will not be able to identify workers from the amqp point of view.

The side effect of that is if a worker stuck, bug or whatever and doesn't consume messages anymore, we will not be able to see it. One of the other worker will continue to notify that scheduler-node-1 works and consume new messages even if all of them are dead/stuck except one.

So I think that each rpc  servers (each workers) should have a different 'server' ,like: 

    scheduler
    scheduler.scheduler-node-1-worker-1
    scheduler.scheduler-node-1-worker-2
    scheduler.scheduler-node-1-worker-3

Yeah I'm not sure if nova can take a domain scoped token, I can test tho.  Brad is correct that we are still using a project scoped token here.

The scope of access hasn't really changed.  Keystone v3 introduces the idea of a Domain Admin which I don't believe has made it to the other services yet.  So we have this distinction of a Cloud Admin vs Domain Admin.

Cloud Admin is root and do anything across Domains.
Domain Admin can only manager resources in it's domain.

I guess proper setup of Horizon's nova policy file should prevent this. Users with only domain level access shouldn't even see the panel.

Part of my confusion on this is coming about because the interface we are being provided with seems one step off:  project scoped token are used for specifying the lowest level of access (single project access), as well as the highest level of access (admin level - across all projects access), but we have a separate authentication token for specifying a medium level access (access to stuff in some of the projects).  Not something I expect us to solve here, but I think that's part of the reason I'm having a hard time settling in on this.
