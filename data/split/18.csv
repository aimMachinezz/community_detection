I don't believe the idea of a job-template parameter exists in JJB, if you define a key at that level it never gets picked up within the template or any macros it references. Unless that is something you'd like to see added?

So perhaps current behaviour is better described as (dropped parameter for sake of brevity):

 defaults -> project -> project instance -> job-group -> job-group instance


I think that:

 defaults -> project -> job-group -> job-group instance  -> project instance

might be more consistent and useful than:

 defaults -> job-group -> job-group instance -> project -> project instance

Course both are better than the current situation :)


The difference being at the level at which the knowledge about what is the best value to use varies and whether you consider the project params and job-group params more global defaults with the instance ones being specific overrides. Projects can include multiple job groups, where the job-group and it's job may know more about what values should be used than the project, and with the second one i think there is a greater chance of ending up having to override the same param at both the project and project instance level to get the desired behaviour.


Think the hierarchy can be shown as:

 - project
     - project instance

 - project
     - job-group
         - job-group instance
             - project instance

The problem at the moment is with the second item above, the job-group params are overridden by job-group instance params and the result overrides both the project instance and project level params.


I'm assuming here of course based on some experiments additionally with nested job-groups that it seems better to treat project params as a project level defaults so you can have something like the following:

 defaults ->
   project (consider default) params ->

  In the applyDefaults usage under consideration from the previous bullet point
  the ""template"" in line 271 ends up being the ""override_dict"" in this method. I
  know, it's ugly and confusing as hell and I can't wait to start defining
  jenkins jobs in pure Python without the YamlParser.

    So perhaps current behaviour is better described as (dropped parameter for sake
        of brevity):

    defaults -> project -> project instance -> job-group -> job-group instance

This should include job template.

    I think that:

    defaults -> project -> job-group -> job-group instance -> project instance

    might be more consistent and useful than:

    defaults -> job-group -> job-group instance -> project -> project instance

What makes the former more consistent?

    Course both are better than the current situation :)

    The difference being at the level at which the knowledge about what is the
    best value to use varies and whether you consider the project params and
    job-group params more global defaults with the instance ones being specific

I consider project instance params to be more specific than project params and
job group instance params to be more specific than job group params.

However, it's still not clear to me why you think project params are less
specific than job group params or how this could be expected to fit with a JJB
user's intution. Most people that I have talked to expect exactly the override
order I described in my previous comment and I suspect I would have just as
difficult a time explaining your proposed override order as I do explaining the
current override order.

    overrides. Projects can include multiple job groups, where the job-group and

True, projects can contain multiple groups, but in almost 100% of usages I
define job group specific JJB variables that I expect to set values for at the
project and project instance level. When I use the same job group multiple times
within a given project it is usually for the same of reifying git branch
specific pipelines so the number of variables that need to be set at the project
instance level is actually relatively small. If job groups end up overriding
project parameters then I will have to set values I am currently setting at the
project level at each individual project instance level which will cause my
project yaml blocks to increase in size by 2-3 times.

    it's job may know more about what values should be used than the project,
    and with the second one i think there is a greater chance of ending up
    having to override the same param at both the project and project instance
    level to get the desired behaviour.

I don't grok the second part of this sentence.

    Think the hierarchy can be shown as:

    - project
      - project instance

    - project
      - job-group
        - job-group instance
          - project instance

Why does this notation and terminology differ from the notation shown below?
Keep in mind other people may be reading these comments so it will help them to
keep up with our discussion if we avoid introducing extraneous notation.

    To be consistent I think we need to either have parent always override child
    or child override parent levels. One or the other. The problem at the moment

My strong preference is that parent always override child, assuming that in the
project and job-group relationship we are agreed that ""project"" is the parent
and ""job-group"" is the child. The reason for this is that at the job group level
we don't know anything about how this job group will be used, we just have a
vague idea that it might be used in some particular way--with this in mind we
set default values here that we can then expect may be overridden by variables
set at the project level. In other words, a job group is not as specific as a
project.

I consider job groups to be less specific than projects because job groups can
be used in many different projects. A job group might for example be specific to
""clojure test and build jobs""; a project might then be ""puppet-server"" or
""puppetdb"" both of which are clojure projects that need to ""reuse"" the
previously-mentioned ""clojure test and build jobs""; however, puppet-server and
puppetdb may need to override variables used in their shared pipeline.

Similarly, job templates are less specific than job groups because a given job
template might be used in different job groups with slightly different purposes
or even multiple times within the same job group so that when reified and used
to create a jenkins job they can be run in parallel with each job running a
subset of tests (which is one way to reduce overall test execution time when a
test suite would otherwise be expected to run on the order of hours).

    is with the second item above, the job-group params are overridden by
    job-group instance params and the result overrides both the project instance
    and project level params.

    I'm assuming here of course based on some experiments additionally with
    nested job-groups that it seems better to treat project params as a project
    level defaults so you can have something like the following:

We already have a way to set defaults on a per-project basis...using JJB
defaults.  Why do we need more? Once we are at the ""project"" level we are about
as specific as we can be and it really seems to me like the principle driving
override order should be ""more specific, higher priority; less specific, lower
priority"".

    defaults ->
      project (consider default) params ->
        job-group level 1 (consider default) params ->

I'm not sure I understand the ""level N"" references here. Is this in reference to
nested job groups? In that case what does ""job level 1"" and ""job level 2"" below
reference?

Also, does level 2 job group contain level 1 or vice versa it's not clear to me
which job group in your example ""contains"" the other and that information is
absolutely necessary for us to agree on an override order.

          job-group level 2 (consider default) params ->
            job level 2 instance params ->
              job level 1 instance params ->
                project instance params

    Essentially the RHS always overrides LHS, no matter how deep you job in
    levels around grouping data.

    I'm not sure with the alternative precedence you proposed what would be the
    correct order that would make sense and be consistent when considering the
    possibility of nested job-groups.

I'll try using your notation to describe my ideal precedence again this time
adding the nested job groups. I will also include job templates since as I've
demonstrated variables set on job templates *are* included during template
expansion:

  defaults ->
    job-template params ->
      [... -> job-group level N+1 params -> job-group level N+1 instance params ]
        [... -> job-group level N params -> job-group level N instance params ]
          job-group level 1 params -> job-group level 1 instance params ->
            project params ->
              project instance params

In this example ""level 1"" job groups are those that are contained by projects.
""level N + 1"" job groups are contained by ""level N"" job groups. For example
suppose we have a job group contained by a project that itself contains a second
job group. The second job group is referenced within the ""jobs"" list of the
first and would be considered a ""level 2"" job group whereas the first would be
considered a ""level 1"" job group.",False,18

We find that attaching a BGPVPN to a network has the benefit of simplicity by not requiring the instantiation of a router object to setup a router object. 

If a router is required to interconnect a network with a VPN, we end up with additional complexity to address cases where multiple networks are connected to a router but only some of them have to be bound to an external VPN (for instance, we have networks A and B connected to router X, and we want only network A to be advertised in the VPN).

[ Moreover, attaching VPNs to networks is what will be most natural for l2 (Ethernet VPNs). ]


Now, your question ""what is the behavior if a network associated with a VPN is attached to a router?"" is a relevant question: a possibility would be that, by default, the prefixes behind that router are not connected to the VPN, but can be optionally connected to the VPN (assuming we introduce an optional flag to enable that).",False,18

Mostly just wanted to point out that I do not believe removing the puppet master is a problem if we go down this road since we are already using ansible with the puppet master and mordred has a plan to use ansible without the puppet master.

Now as far as removing the puppet master it is a thing that mordred has been playing with for several reasons. The puppet master makes it hard to upgrade puppet. All your clients and agents have to be in agreement over the version they support which means a large uplift the world puppet upgrade scenario. The master is essentially a fixed resource that all agents call into artificially limiting the number of concurrent puppet runs. And as currently deployed it is a spof. By having ansible run puppet apply on nodes instead of puppet agent we avoid much of that.

See http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23tripleo/%23tripleo.2015-02-04.log at about 2015-02-04T20:19:59 for his justifications to dprince.

Note that this does mean we need some way of providing sensitive data to the nodes. Mordreds plan there is to have ansible copy hiera data from where ansible runs onto the node before puppet apply runs.

But again this isn't really a concern for this spec. Which was what I was trying to point out particularly for other reviewers that might be concerned that doing this will disrupt mordred's efforts around removing the master.",False,18

In short, we would need at least one VNID per VPN connection object for L2 interconnects and potentially a second VNID when attaching it to an L3 router or L3 BGP speaker using VXLAN as the encap.

sorry to be a pain but I still feel I need to push for the option of attaching the router. I know that in particular a might want to only advertise certain subnets, but think of the opposite use-case. You have a multi-tenant cloud that is allowing end-users to attach a cloud to their own MPLS IP VPN. The user might then add an extra application tier or network and wants that to be advertised automatically, with no knowledge of which specific VPN connection to use. In a lot of cases, the network admin doing the original binding of the VPN to the neutron Router could be an admin of sorts and then a developer just needs one more subnet, taken from an existing pool. Then the new subnet would automatically be reachable.

In quite a few DC designs, people will use the MPLS VPN connection just to attach the system to an more capable exit Gateway rather than a software-based exit point or top of rack. But the DC-PE might not have a northbound VPN. The MPLS parameters would be used in that case to connect just between the overlay and DC. And thus, when a user adds a network to a connected router, the network is automatically advertised out. Basically this is the role of an L3 gateway and we've seen a lot of traction for a model like this from customers.

Finally, depending on the implementation, having both the network and router attachment options simultaneously actually makes sense. The network attachment can allow DC-PEs or other BGP-VPN/EVPN capable routers to both provide L3 connectivity to the whole set of subnets (when attached to a router) but also would allow an L2-capable EVPN speaking TOR or similar to provide L2 gateway roles, adding bare-metal connection capabilities to an overlay-based solution in a relatively simple manner.

What I mean is that we don't even need to make then mutually exclusive, if this makes sense at all.

Thanks,
Diego",False,18

Do we have a fundamental disagreement over whether Network or Router should be the thing a VPN attaches to? Or do we have two (or more) example backends that are currently incomplete?

I think it makes sense to have the right abstractions at the right level. We don't need to talk about PE-CE attachement circuits or MPLS tunnels to express the connectivity needs between a tenant and external VPNs.

Assuming that your use-case is the edge vpn orchestration in the edge-vpn spec, then it seems to me that we are simply talking about related, but distinct use cases.

One possible way to look at this is to consider that, in the context of this proposal, how the PE-CE link is implemented will depend on the driver, and that a driver needing per-VPN specific PE-CE connectivity details could have its own API used to specify these parameters.",False,18

Its good suggestion , but eventually it did not work for me. I have tried to execute some nova commands. I found that , Nova does not allow to resume a paused state vm. Nova resume only works when the state of VM is in suspend state. Nova unpuase only works when the state of VM is in pause state.
Furthermore, the REST API call's for both are different in its action. Nova takes unpause as an action in the request body. Similarly Nova takes resume as an action in the request body. Heat currently supports resume with action request resume as in its request body, which will not work for paused state stack.

http post ''{""read"": [""uiserid1"", ""userid2""], ""write"": [""userid3""]}' to /v1/container/acl

Its race prone though. To add an entry, you have to download the old one, make your modifications, and re-post it back, hopefully without someone doing the same thing in the process, braking things.

This changes it to split out the users from the document posted so that records in the acl are rest addressable and atomically create/deletable.

So instead, you:
curl -d '{""access"":""read""}' https://barbican/v1/container/foo/acl/user/userid1

To undo that acl entry, you just delete it, ala
curl -X DELETE https://barbican/v1/container/foo/acl/user/userid1/read

Then creates/deletes to bob don't race with creates/deletes to user joe in the same acl. The race is handled inside the Barbican database where its easy to deal with.

Atomic'ness is the biggest issue at the moment. There is no race free way to manage the acl entries and being security related, really must be safe.

Currently, you need to put an acl on the Container and then iterate on the container's secrets and add acl's on all of the secrets. Deleting the stack requires the opposite. When you are doing this in a template, this is significantly more work than needed and potentially error prone. Both the heat engine and the barbican api will see the extra load, and heat will potentially have to store a lot more state in its db. Also, what happens if a secret was a member of a container when the stack was launched, but removed before the heat stack was deleted? Would that permission stick around incorrectly?

Heat Resources are basically thin wrappers around the create/delete methods of the services it orchestrates. Putting very much logic in them is usually a very bad idea and strongly discouraged by the Heat developers. Being required to put much logic in them tends to show deficiencies in the underlying project's API's.

I'm looking for a single PUT/DELETE call that can safely and race free add and remove the ability for a user to be able to gain read access a whole container of secrets.

But your actual argument, that it's just metadata and therefore doesn't matter, is wrong. For a start, AFAICT an attacker can drain the queue so you don't get your notifications.

Going with what is in upstream right now (or when I ran this last week), the default is to set device driver to neutron.services.loadbalancer.drivers.haproxy.namespace_driver.HaproxyNSDriver which no longer exists 

i went digging at the time, there is a bug and some reviews already out, perhaps still pending. Otherwise, we just want the default driver here, not trying to do anythign fancy at this point,

If its the name, you can default the text box to something friendly like ""trac"" for a trac site, and the user can just go create that container.

That being said, I'm looking for a simple way to download a single secret from a
container by container_name and secret name. You are right in that this logic
could all be pushed out into the client to deal with. For this one use case, I think
that is a bad idea for the following reasons:

 * It adds extra load the api side
 * Makes the client much more complex.
    * With this solution, a secret can be retrieved with a single curl call.
    * Without, you probably need to go with the barbican cli in the vm, which
       has a lot of dependencies.
    * I'd like to use this solution with some CentOS 6 vm's and maintaining modern 
      OpenStack client's in that environment is quite a lot of work. But curl works fine.
 * Its unclear how you could use a Container level ACL that allows secrets listed
   within it to be downloaded with the existing Secret retrieval api. That api maybe
   could add a check for the container acl but might degrade performance too

We don't have to assign the empty string in the out of if/else so, just as:

if policy and policy.sorting_method:
    sorting_method = policy.sorting_method
    read_affinity_sort_key = policy.read_affinity_sort_key
else:
    sorting_method = self.sorting_method
    read_affinity_sort_key = self.read_affinity_sort_key

It's python's magic.

The reason I'd prefer using if/else rather than using only if is to catch unexpected wrong behavior.

For example,  if we used if condition to overwrite some variables but we forgot to assign a variable like as:

sorting_method = self.sorting_method
read_affinity_sort_key = self.read_affinity_sort_key
if policy and policy.sorting_method:
    sorting_method = policy.sorting_method
    # Oh no, I forgot to assing read_affinity_sort_key
    # read_affinity_sort_key = policy.read_affinity_sort_key

That would work but would behave bad silently.

If we use if/else syntax instead of above like as:

if policy and policy.sorting_method:
    sorting_method = policy.sorting_method
    read_affinity_sort_key = policy.read_affinity_sort_key
else:
    sorting_method = self.sorting_method
    # Oh no, I forgot to assing read_affinity_sort_key
    # read_affinity_sort_key = self.read_affinity_sort_key

We absolutely can see an error in the invalid case and it will be able to remove silent error.

- The app itself implements HA via a load-balanced N+k pool architecture.  It has no requirements on the underlying platform to e.g. restart failed VMs within a certain time period.
- Here 'HA' refers to availability for completing new call connection attempts.  It does not refer to keeping existing calls up, though as Clearwater is just a signalling plane rather than the media plane the end-user experience would be that the call (i.e. the audio) would continue uninterrupted, but any subsequent actions requiring signalling (e.g. conferencing in a 3rd party) would fail.
- The 'must be able to offer SLAs' point is that application-level HA by itself is insufficient to offer an SLA of e.g. 5 9's new call availability; that requires the underlying cloud platform itself to be at least that reliable itself.",False,18

Virtualisation - if done dumbly - could break that calculus if significant numbers of VMs are on the same host (obviously having >k on a host would do it).  So this is really saying ""in order to meet 5 9's or similar SLAs, N+k architected products have to be able to ensure that there are not too many VMs on the same host"" - leading to the point that there seems to be a scheduler gap here.

In IPVPN the same level of trust can be achieved since once your traffic is in the service provider network, it is segmented with MPLS, and no one, even other service provider customers can access your flow. Encryption is no needed anymore.

But the level of trust can be compared.
