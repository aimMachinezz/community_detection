I think it still makes sense to allow users to define a global, non-default TTL that applies to all queues as a safeguard.  Here's another example where it would be useful:

What happens if a service, say nova-conductor, is stopped/crashed/disconnected for a while?  The conductor queue isn't auto_delete, and exclusive doesn't make sense, so it will accumulate messages while the service is down since there are no consumers.  Given a high enough message rate in a large scale deployment, or a long enough time for the service to be stopped, the queue can accumulate a very large number of messages and begin to cause performance problems and memory pressure.

The backup['created_at'] field is generated when the backup entry is created.  After that, I set the 'data_timestamp' field to be the same as 'created_at' if it is for snapshot backup.  That is why I do this in two steps:

Step 1: Create backup entry in DB and 'created_at' will be generated automatically.

Step 2: Update 'data_timestamp' to be the same as 'created_at' for snapshot backup.

I don't know how to do this in one step.  Let me know if you know how this can be done.  Thanks!",False,20

I got your point when I examined your comment [1].

In case of ipmitool, inject nmi is just a trigger, the ipmitool command execution time is very short, in this sense, the command is async.

However in case of iRMC, I believe other vendor's BMC as well, we can get the OS status via OOB.

So I agree with you that it's not good idea that Ironic interact user's OS directly, but vendor's BMC can query the OS status without interacting user's OS directly.

One of those is called ceilometer and covers the meter and event gathering (via polling and notifications) and api on existing storage models. 2) The code for alarming has been moved to 'aodh' (pronounced like the letter 'a' in 'say' or 'day').

I mention because it has some impact on where some of the activity being handled by the proposed workflow would happen:

Ceilometer pollsters and notification agents would ""hear"" measures from polling nova-compute or receiving notifications from Nova. Aodh would have threshold alarms that check these thresholds at various intervals.

A few parties have pointed out that the sheer volume of data required for the measure->store<-query model described above limits the scalability and responsiveness of that solution. An alternative is in progress which uses an event evaluator (see blog posting: https://01.org/openstack/blogs/cabuerger/2015/aodh-alarm-events-openstack ).

This one will need to reference the new spec.

I think there are arguments to be made either way -- to allow adding even if it violates the constraint, or to prevent adding.  Obviously this is a non-issue for soft policies (which would always succeed).  If we allow hard policies to be violated in this way, it would be useful to return a warning, and perhaps also have an API for listing violations within a group which have crept in because of adding instances post-build.

Implicitly creating groups is an interesting idea, but I think it could get tricky, given that group policies, if we add scopes, can have multiple independent scopes which overlap in arbitrary ways, and a single group can have policies in multiple scopes.  So then the question is -- what group do we create implicitly for a given instance?  There will be many possibilities in the general case.

This method should do only common things.

(1) Can you move the added logic a separate method and call it in get()?

(2) In addition, I think having this logic in the API level can be fragile.
For example, when we enable a pagination the response will as follows.
It works even in a case of pagination, but we cannot know whether we have
more variations.

{""ports_links"": [{""href"": ""http://172.16.18.46:9696/v2.0/ports.json?fields=foo&limit=2&marker=ad662e3f-1fc9-4d2d-a74e-01f2e02621f7"", ""rel"": ""next""}, {""href"": ""http://172.16.18.46:9696/v2.0/ports.json?fields=foo&limit=2&marker=994f3389-9159-42e2-a35f-10041bc3b560&page_reverse=True"", ""rel"": ""previous""}], ""ports"": [{}, {}]}

I would suggest not to change do_request itself.
Instead, we should do this kind of things after we get some final result,
i.e., a returned value from list() or get().
(Note that get() is used inside list()...)

We also need to consider how we handle I/O thread placement when we have guest NUMA pinning, and also strict CPU pinning in effect. This in turn may also require us to consider association between guest devices and guest NUMA nodes.

Having said that, I think your integration strategy is problematic, because later on the wiring might not be appropriate for your platform and what happens then? You're relying on an implementation specific that is not meant to be public, and for your own sake it'd be best if you didn't rely on it.

Or am I barking up at the wrong tree?",False,20

Please note that when a user creates a volume that supports replication, he/she has to provide a volume type.  Creating a CG is the same and it needs user's input for a volume type (or more than 1 volume types).

When you specify 'pool', that means you want all volumes in that pool to be replicated together.  If that is not what you want, then you can specify a different grouping 'volgrp'.  It is up to the driver to decide what kind of special grouping makes sense.

I think with pool based replication, this problem exists any way.  Correct me if I'm wrong, Tom.  There may be no easy way to remove a volume from the pool.  This problem will be there even if you go with a new Volume Group construct.  With any grouping, you have to add individual volume to the grouping.  With the pool type of grouping, you just have to make sure that you add all volumes in that pool to the grouping.  There may be no way to remove a volume from that grouping (the pool) unless if you delete it.  I want to stress again that this problem exists whether you use CG as the grouping construct or create a new Volume Group construct.

CG to me means replication first, and then snapshot, because I worked on a DR product that only uses CG replication for failover/failback without using CG snapshot.  So I never feel it complicates things when trying to add replication to the existing CG flow.  I'm certainly open to design this differently if folks prefer a different solution.

Even if we introduce Volume Group, we'll have to solve many of the same problems that we try to solve here.  We'll have to create a Volume Group first and then create volume and add to the group.  Add to / remove from the group will be needed as well.  The challenge with not being able to remove a volume from a pool will still be there.  To create a Volume Group, we need to add logic to the scheduler to pick a backend for the Volume Group that can support more than 1 volume types (or 1 group type).

Sure, I'll take a look of Smaug.  It has always been a debate on how much Cinder should do and how much a service at a higher layer should do.  I think that because the storage array level APIs to create a replication group of volumes, enable/disable replication, failover, etc are different at volume level and group level, we still need to enable it in Cinder for another project to use.",False,20

We don't expose *those* capabilities in Cinder today because they are at the pool (or set of pools) level and would need to be under cloud admin control, whereas Cinder CGs as implemented are tenant/user controlled constructs.

Correspondingly, there's a tension between admin control of the pool/replication group and tenant/user control of CG/logical replication groups.

So, to be explicit, I think you are correct in saying that when I push the idea of a more general Volume Group (more general than CG group) that may or may not be valid, but that it does not by itself solve the question of how to handle pool replication (or more generally, replication based on ""physical"" groups - pools, sets of pools, entire backends).",False,20

After reading Tom's comments on replicating a pool, I thought that can be solved here too because a few folks from NetApp have implemented CG for snapshot in Manila (based on the Cinder implementation with some changes) which allows shares in the same pool to be snapshotted together.  I know it is not replication, but it does group all the shares in the same pool together in a CG.

Not that I want to boil the ocean, but if we don't think about how to solve both replicating CG and replicating a pool, we could come up with a design that needs to be changed soon.  This design can be for CG replication only, but some other ideas such as the Volume Group will change everything.  Also Tom thought about Replication Group.  If a CG Replication is not a Replication Group, what is it?  Maybe at the end, we decide these two cases should be handled differently, but I'd like at least to explore the possibility of using common APIs.

I don't know if pool replication can be done without any change to the common code.  This is because a driver cannot update volume statuses directly.  Somehow the manager needs to know that a pool of volumes are being replicated and the statuses of all volumes in the pool need to be updated.

As-is replication is an admin action and a normal user doesn't know much or anything about it, they just create a volume with a replicated volume type and thats it, right?

Now though a user needs to know that some particular replicated type of volume needs to be in a CG first, and volumes created from that type are only replicated if they are added to the CG? Or maybe not...

Seems like it might be confusing because if the volume type gets the volume scheduled into a pool that would be replicated, and there is a CG with replication enabled for that pool, you could have volumes that are *not* part of the CG but *are* being replicated because they happened to be the in same pool?

Part of this which I think is going to complicate things is having the ability to add/remove volumes from a cg. In the case where you want to stop replicating a volume that is part of a pool based replication setup you would have to not only remove it from the cg but also migrate it to another pool/backend.

Unfortunately I don't have a great suggestion for how we handle this... but IMO we do need to consider what workflow we would want a user to have and adjust the code to suite. I get the feeling right now we are trying to kind of massage pools and replication into the existing cg workflow which is complicating things. The idea that as a user you just create a volume of a certain type and things are replicated is, IMO, a good bar to set for this. If its not possible thats ok, but we should at least consider it... If we are going to push replication complexities onto a normal user maybe we should be looking more at what that new project (smaug?) does and how we can better integrate with that type of setup.",False,20

I get what you are saying about us having the problems with volumes moving between pools and adding/removing from groups regardless of grouping construct, totally agree with your assessment.

Maybe what we need to clarify is whether or not this spec is proposing a way to allow for replicating CG's *only*, or if it is to support replication for backends who can only do pool or whole backend replication and want a way to expose that. If its only CG's than no problem, I'll stop rambling and +1 this.

If it isn't, and we are trying to allow for pools to be replicated, then I have some issue with the way we are exposing this. The main point I'm hoping to make is that we shouldn't force a user of the cloud (not the operator/deployer/admin) to know whether or not they need to use a CG with some replicated volume types to actually get a volume replicated.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but my assumption is that the whole point of this being brought up is that the pool based replicators want to have the ability to manage that feature of the array.

I was supposed to make the CG dependent on the Type Group.  A Type Group is a group that supports a group of volume types.  A Type Group can have different capabilities depending on how admin sets it up.  It can be associated with a CG or some other groupings.  I just went back to the review history and refreshed my memory.  Type Group was in the spec up to patch set 6 when Duncan asked a question on how to handle backend supporting multiple Type Groups.  After that it got dropped due to the complexity.

In that review, Ben also raised concerns on replication CG.  After reading his comments again and thinking about Tom's concerns, I think one problem is exactly what Patrick raised earlier that you cannot remove a volume from a pool without deleting it or migrating it to another pool.  For a grouping not in a pool, we can remove a volume from it without deleting the volume.  Sounds like we either need to have a different set of APIs just for a pool or we can have a common set of APIs but pool can support create/delete volume but not add/remove volume (add/remove will be optional)?

For pool and other types of grouping, the admin will set up pool and grouping on the array and set up volume types.  When creating a volume given correct volume type, the volume will be placed in the pool or grouping.  So this part is taken care of by volume type and extra specs.

Then we will have an API for admin to add (or create) a replication_resource (which is a pool or grouping) with all the volumes (that are already created and placed in the pool or grouping in the array).  When admin calls this API, Cinder will know all these volumes are part of this replication_resource (pool or grouping) and make the change in the db.  We are not providing APIs to add a volume to the pool or grouping for the reasons we discussed previously.

We will need an API to delete this replication_resource, which will just remove this entry and the relationship with the volumes.  Deleting volume is still a separate operation as before.",False,20

The cgsnapshots table has a relationship with the consistencygroups table.  We can add another table cgreplications if needed and that will hold mirror groups.  This is for Replication Group that is consistent.  If the Replication Group is not consistent, then that is different.

It will be great if you can provide a list of all the groupings with names that you are trying to support. Based on my understanding of your comments, there are two types groupings for replication that you are trying to support:

1. Replicating all volumes in a pool.

2. Replicating a group of volumes based on policy but they are not consistent.

3. CG for replication (Sounds like you don't support this one today.  Is there plan to support it in the future)?

Still looks weird as I haven't seen an example like this.  With this, at least we don't need to add new APIs for registering a pool so that's good.

I wonder if it makes sense to create a new replication resource with this enable API.  After the resource is created, we can do disable/failover on this resource.  Something like this:

This does need to create a new replications table though.

""I don't know if this is an acceptable format for an URL. Usually we should have a resource id in the URL itself: '/v2/<tenant_id>/replication/action""

I wasn't sure what the acceptable formats for a URL were either and after looking around a bit consulted with ameade on this subject, since he knows the domain well (and thingee asked him to be API liason/checker for Cinder).  The above is what we came up with when considering this problem, so I think it or something equivalent will be acceptable.  The critical point, as you say, is whether we have to have the resource id in the URL itself.  Being able to put a uuid or host string in the bodyinstead frees us from having to create a uuid for pools and backends just to get this job done.

On the question of how to update statuses, I'm thinking that the manager could pass in a list of the volume uuids the way you are now doing for CGs (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/229580/) and the driver can return a model update with
statuses for all these.",False,20

volume_api.enable_replication would itself call _enable_replication_on volume, _enable_replication_on_CG, _enable_replication_on_host as appropriate.

Admin calls this API and provides a resource identifier (a pool name or a name of this other grouping) and UUID's of all volumes in this pool or grouping.  We'll need a replication_resources table in the db.  After registering, an entry will be added to the table and each volume will have a foreign key referencing the id of this replication_resource.

For Replication CG, tenant will create CG and add volumes to the CG, using the volume types provided by the admin.  The replication CG will be associated with a replication resource db entry as well.

A volume that is replicable will also be associated with a replication resource db entry.

Only admin can run the replication actions such as enable-replication/disable-replication/failover-replication.",False,20

'/v2/<tenant_id>/replication_resources/<resource uuid>/action'

1) Have a common replication API for volume, CG, or pool.

2) Add a new table for pool in the db.

3) Add a new column pool_id in the volume table.

4) Add new APIs to import/export a pool.

5) When a volume is created, if it is part of a pool, driver can return {'pool_name': 'xxx'} and manager needs to figure out which pool it is in the db and assign pool_id to the volume in the volumes table.  (maybe there's a better way to associate a volume to a pool_id)

Pros: One set of APIs for volume, CG, and pools.

Cons: The existing Replication API will be changed; Need to add new API to manage pools.

I don't know which backend has support for a different grouping other than CG or pool.  If it is replicating a group of volumes without ensuring data consistency, I don't see why it cannot be achieved by replicating each volume individually.  If it is replicating a group of volumes to ensure data consistency and a volume can be add/remove to/from a group, then we can use CG for it.  If it is replicating a group of volumes to ensure data consistency and a volume can not be add/remove to/from a group, then it seems more like a pool.

Also, the primary key should not contain a VARCHAR field.

Many Nodes will have the same properties; storing each property as a VARCHAR is not normalized. Instead, we should have a separate table for properties, and a cross-join table here.

So I suggest this:

Ultimately, it doesn't matter if it is a little racey. The goal is not to have a set number of duplicate downloads. The goal is to minimize that with some ceiling for allowable duplicates to ensure success a hiccup doesn't cause n requests to hang. A counting semaphore could be used.

 Here is the libvirt doc string to describe it underly function detachDeviceFlags.
 http://paste.openstack.org/show/480330/

 It says:
 detaching a device from a running domain may be asynchronous.
 and it suggests:
 To check whether the device was successfully removed, either recheck domain
 configuration using virDomainGetXMLDesc() or add handler for
 VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_DEVICE_REMOVED

 Also Daniel elaborated it, and gave us more some scenarios about it.

 it is not guaranteed to succeed. What happens is that the hypervisor injects
 an ACPI request to unplug the device. The guest OS must co-operate by releasing
 the device, before the hypervisor will complete the action of physically
 removing it. So you require a guest OS that supports ACPI unplug of course,
 and if the guest is crashed or being malicious there is no guarantee the unplug
 will succeed. Libvirt will wait a short while for success, but you must monitor
 for libvirt events to see if/when it finally completes. This delayed release has
 implications for when Nova can mark the PCI device as unused and available for
 other guests to assign.


 Now I have checked the code, both detach volume or detach interface call

              guest . detach_device ( cfg , live = True )


 And for detach_interface in nova/compute/manager.py:

 It just detach_interface, no double check the device is detached finally.
 Now I will support the detach SRIOV code.
 https://review.openstack.org/#/c/139910/
 I'm not sure should I need to double check the device is finally detached.

 If yes.

 What should I support?

 3 options:
 1. Just ignored it. keep the nova code.

 2. sync check.
 as the libvirt suggests: use virDomainGetXMLDesc()

 def detach_interface(self, context, instance, port_id):
    self.driver.detach_interface(instance, condemned)
    # just pseudo-code
    for i in range(1, 51):
       if not(virDomainGetXMLDesc()):
            sleep(1)
        else if i == 51：
            raise exception
        else:
            break
    self.network_api.deallocate_port_for_instance(
        context, instance, port_id)


 3. async notification.
  as the libvirt suggests:
 add event handler for VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_DEVICE_REMOVED.

 call network_api.deallocate_port_for_instance in a backend task.
 The backend receives the event result from event handler by AMPQ and filter the
 device is the the expected interface device, not the volume device.

 Then backend call network_api.deallocate_port_for_instance to deallocate the port.



 I have not check the volume detach, not sure it has the same issues.

 Beside this issue:

 hypervisors may prevent this operation if there is a current
 block copy operation on the device being detached;",False,20

 This is not only for SRIOV device, any other device should also  have the same problem.

 IMO this is something we could do outside of this spec, since it would make the existing PCI detach code in the libvirt driver more robust, but I'm just making a note for that here. Hint: this should come early in the series for this change.

I've removed the 'editable' field as it remained over from some prior work and was no longer needed.
I've also taken out the 'service' field as the JS can determine it relatively easy and currently is aware of the distinction.

The bit of logic around getting the display_name is as is from the current Django code.
I could leave it to the callee to do this bit though it'll add complexity on the JS end.

Actually i was thinking to introduce a config variable, say ""only_oob_inspection"" for this. By default, value will be false which means ilo drivers will do both in-band and OOB inspection. if the config variable is set to true, it will not perform in-band inspection.

The purpose is that eventually in future we would want to avoid inband inspection when these properties could be discovered OOB in iLO. Secondly, we want customer to have the flexibility for OOB inspection alone.

Further to that - I think that implicit random flags like this in the API are not a good way forward (although I understand the need to get stuff done).

What we really should be designing is a way for neutron to expose to Nova data about different ports, which Nova can match to actual PCIDevices and expose in pools, and make scheduling decisions based on. Currently this is done by adding freeform ""tags"" to a whitelist in the nova.conf, which then match arbitrary values set on the network or potentially port (we actually don't have a way to expose any port data for scheduling purposes, only for provisioning). This is not exactly user friendly or even sensible.

For example, whilelist entries will look file [{""address"": ""addr1"", physical_network"": ""physnet0"", ""dev_group"": ""alice""}, {""address"": ""addr2"": ""physical_network"": ""physnet0"", ""dev_group: ""bob""}].

So if user just runs 'nova bot ... --nic port-id=$id', we just take any PCI device from the appropriate phys net. If user specifies '--nic port-id=$id,dev_group=alice"" we search for device that have both physnet=physnet0 and dev_group=alice.

This does not require Neutron modifications from what I can see.

And just like you said, we could even manually generate this 'dev_group' for whitelist entries, e.g. group by physnet, sort by address, enumerate the result to generate $physnet-$linkno attribute.

In this case, most likely, only 1 PF will be accessible to user.

There is an DHCP/IP-related issue with any implementation which doesn't touch Neutron. 

Consider following environment:
2 SR-IOV-capable NICs, each has 1 PF. Implementation proposed by Roman will have an issue when Neutron gives out 2 IPs instead of 1 since there are 2 ports are being created for each reduntant VM. A bond interface will receive only one IP interface and it is not clear which IP out of 2 it's going to be. That also means that IP addresses which are being assigned but not used, are a dead weight.

If you'd assign 2 PFs 2 different physnets and then create 2 different Neutron networks, then you'd have a situation when only one PF can be used to assign VFs when redundancy is not required while keeping VFs in the same L3 network. Since these PFs are in fact connected to the same physical network, user would expect to be able to assign a VF from any of these to a VM and be able to have an IP from the same L3 network as redundant VMs. But this is not going to work since 2 different Neutron networks will have 2 different subnets and IP ranges (Neutron will not allow assigning same subnet to different networks).",False,20

The key is that physnet-1 and physnet-2 are basically the same physical network ""physnet"". And that's the only change that needs to be taken care of by neutron.

But, test code is a bit different and being explicit is a good thing. In general this approach is much better for tests. Being explicit in what they're creating like this makes debugging in the failure case much simpler,  especially for people coming looking at it for the first time.(or after a long time) Having to jump around to figure out what test is trying to do (and whether it's doing it correctly) makes debugging failures much more difficult. 

Sure, it's a bit more verbose and similar calls are made in other test methods,  but it's much easier to read and understand what the test is doing from a single place. That's what really matters when you need to debug failures. Not that you went to the greatest lengths to deduplicate code with other test methods in a different class.

Helper methods are really only needed if there is a shared setup phase between multiple tests in a single class, which is not the case here. Or if there are common setup bits that are nominally irrelevant to the test method, (like network creation and attachment to a server)  which is also not the case here.

- We could use flavors, however we should take care that an instance cannot be resized (i.e. changing the flavor) from a spot flavor to a non-spot flavor.
- We could expose it using an API extension, bumping the micro-version and marking the instances as spot directly in the DB.
- We could consider tags, but we should have a way to protect them (i.e. if a user request a spot, it cannot be ""un-spotted"" by removing a tag).

1: per-node explicit config:

dev_group pros:

 - unified syntax for affinity and anti-affinity allocations

dev_group cons:

 - introduces a new term 'device group' that is not self explanatory

pf-placement-not-near pros:

 - self explanatory

pf-placement-not-near cons:

 - anti-affinity case will need a new attribute (pf-placement-near)
 - longer to type :-) (minor)

Initially, when this feature was designed for local needs, I introduced dev_group with the same thing in mind -- to have a possibility to support affinity case. However, it turned out that it was never needed. TBH, currently I have no goal to support affinity case as I'm not sure it's useful at all, though I don't mind doing that if that's useful as it doesn't add much work anyway.

Actually, I have no preference to either way, but as other people suggested that dev_group could be not the best UX, I'd wait for them to reply before updating the spec.

When using NUMA, the guest will be bound to a specific host NUMA node. Currently Nova will attempt to allocate VFs from a device on the same NUMA node that the guest is set to run on. If no free VFs are available the guest will not be booted.
