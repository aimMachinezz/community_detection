I like the idea, but there are a few tough nuts to crack.  The main problem with the company admin from my perspective is partly in determining who should get that role.  For example:

Today the OpenStack Foundation does ask for a signature on a legal contract when a company wants a logo/trademark license.  But the person who signs it tends to be an executive or lawyer....e.g. not the same person who is probably actually running refstack-client and submitting results to refstack.net, and not even likely the same person who would be using refstack to administer who can do things.  I suspect the same is probably true when a company asks to be listed in the Marketplace, but I don't know for sure--that's something we could ask the Foundation.

Also, people's roles within a company tend to shift pretty quickly in my experience (and people change employers a lot too), so there's a problem of keeping the company_admin role up to date.  

Solving the question of who is an employee of a company is relatively simple by comparison: most companies (in my experience) tend to be pretty good about cutting off an employee's company email when he or she leaves the company, so that's something we can use for initial verification and to periodically clean the rosters.  There are some cases where this is a bit harder (for example, people that work for Yahoo have a @yahoo-inc.com email address while almost anyone can get an @yahoo.com address), but I think corner cases like that could probably be managed.

Solving the question of who can submit results for a given product and call them company-official is harder.  The company_admin role could be useful for that if we have means of figuring out who should get that role.  We could ask the Foundation to take on the responsibility of figuring that out, but I'm not sure they actually have any better means than we do of establishing it and keeping it current.  Perhaps that's a question we should discuss with the Foundation directly?",False,19

  RefStrack to validate the legitimacy of the companies. 

  Vendor registration can be done as describe below:

   1. The Foundation will provide a  JSON file which  includes a list
      of the company names with their associated attributes ( such
      as company_admin user names, product names ...).  
      RefStack will provide an API to import this JSON file.  JSON
      import will be performed by the general_admin.
   2. RefStack may provide a user interface to add/delete company
      profiles.  Only general_admin user can add/delete company
      object.  Both general_admin and company_admin are allow to
      perform update to the company profile.",False,19

Does this method's implementation succesfully remove both the snapshot and the flattened clone as we would need to do when the image update fails?

I'm asking because my knowledge of the underlying RBD commands isn't that great when it comes to this and I don't have time to look it up.

Be careful in changing this method to remove the parent of the snapshot, which would be the flattened clone of the VM's disk.  If this method is re-used to cleanup the temporary snapshot of the VM's disk during an error on clone/flatten as it currently is in imagebackend, this would likely result in an attempt to remove the VM's disk if my thinking is correct.

I'm thinking you need two separate cleanup methods, one to cleanup the temporary snapshot of the VM disk that is used to create the clone that is then flattened, and a separate one to cleanup the flattened clone and its protected snapshot that is sent to Glance, if the Glance update fails.

You could probably get away with 1 method to do the Glance cleanup and just fall back to doing an unprotect/ remove snap on the temp VM disk snapshot in imagebackend.",False,19

There is also an issue when jobs are run multiple times. If only one build can run at anytime and a build is already happening, the build will be considered running while it is really enqueued.  Same effect when a job can run concurrently and a build is already running :-(

According to Jenkins API, the <job name>/build POST returns a 201:

> To programmatically schedule a new build, post to job/build. If the build has parameters, post to job/buildWithParameters and provide the parameters as form data.
> Either way, the successful queueing will result in 201 status code with Location HTTP header pointing the URL of the item in the queue. By polling the api/xml sub-URL of the queue item, you can track the status of the queued task. Generally, the task will go through some state transitions, then eventually it becomes either cancelled (look for the ""cancelled"" boolean property), or gets executed (look for the ""executable"" property that typically points to the AbstractBuild object.) 


https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-12827 has some more details (resolved/wontfix).

So you poll the entry in the queue with something like /queue/item/25/api/xml and once the build starts you get the build #.  Though that still does not solve the issue of short living jobs that would disappear from the queue rather quickly.

Seems the queue items have a 300 seconds TTL from https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26228 . So that should be good enough :)",False,19

Say you have the following domains:
cloud.com,
tenanta.cloud.com,
tenanb.cloud.com

tenanta and tenantb are subdomains of cloud.com.

And the following A records:
www.cloud.com.          172800  IN      A       10.0.0.1
foo.tenanta.cloud.com.          172800  IN      A       10.0.0.2

You'd be able to use it with ww.cloud.com, but not foo.tenanta.cloud.com, bar.tenanta.cloud.com or baz.tenantb.cloud.com. tenanta.cloud.com and tenantb.cloud.com would need their own wild card certs, *.tenanta.cloud.com and *.tenantb.cloud.com respectively.

It is painful if we ask someone to rewrite a driver that they have written according to our driver API and all of sudden it stops working. At the very least we should provide a easy migration path to them if they wish to not split their *OLD* deploy driver in boot/deploy (may be NullBootDriver or something like that).

I'm assuming we would leave it to the Foundation to find the corresponding openstackid for each user, but I'm not sure how easy that will be.

I suppose if they have a list of emails it would be doable as many might have an openstackid with that email for logging into openstack.org, but of course, many may not. Since openstackids are how we define users, some companies might have to go without a company_admin user until someone creates an openstackid account. In any case, results for a company could still be displayed for a company if Chris or someone else were to upload and associate test results him/herself (for previous test results). Unless we just want to just slowly grow the company/company_admin population as future testing against newer capabilities occurs.

What would be the desired workflow be for a new user from a new company trying to get a cloud validated. First email the Foundation?

If we do vendor self-registration, we would have to set up an smtp server on the RefStack infra vm, or maybe one is provided. Would have to look into that. Also worried about the corner cases for programmatic verification of email addresses where the email domain doesn't match the company domain name (ustack.com vs UnitedStack.com is another one).

This check seems to be static right, in that for a given atom it will never change during the lifetime of the engine that it is contained in.

Think about the following operation sequence.

1. start to detach volume from instance in nova-api

2. start to rebuild instance in nova-api, get the instance bdms from db, because the detaching volume don't finish, so the bdms contain the volume that will be detached.

3. start to detach volume from instance in nova-compute, and detaching finish successfully, the bdm of this volume is destroyed.

4. start to rebuild the instance in nova-compute, try to detach all the volumes according to the bdms that pass through from nova-api and contain the volume had been detached. That would be failed, because the bdm of the volume can't be found. Exception VolumeBDMNotFound was raised. See details in:

http://paste.openstack.org/show/474568/

5. Rebuilding failed, the instance is set to ERROR.

I said the result is unpredictable, because the issue must meet the special time sequence, and synchronizing on the instance uuid can't solve the issue, we must set the task state when we do attaching/detaching volume/interface, and make use of the mechanism @check_instance_state in nova-api, so that the operations execute one by one.",False,19

1 Since an instance can have more than one volume attached, you cannot just fail rollback operation on ckeck_detach (or begin_detaching). Because the fault may occure on the second (or more) volume, when the first volume is already detached. In this case the instance is broken, and we should not keep it that. So the splitting the loop looks appropriate to a preliminary check and safetely marking volumes as detaching.

2 About the exception. If you place the first loop in rebuild_instance (not in _rebuild_instance), you'll do not need to workaround _error_out_instance_on_exception behavior. Otherwise i think you need to raise a special exception, not NotImplementedError.

As far as using the user-editable instance name in the volume name, I don't think you can do that unless you're going to truncate it to fit, since the instance display name can be up to 255 characters and that's the limit for the volume name too.

You could use instance.name which is the generated name from the instance_name_template, but the instance_name_template isn't limited in size from what I can tell either.

So if you want to use something from the instance, like name or display_name, you'll most likely need to have a check in here to truncate the final volume name before calling create - or use the instance uuid, but like you said that could change if the volume is attached to another instance, but even if that happens, the volume display_name is editable also and the user could rename the volume in that case.  idk, it's not a huge win either way to me so I'd leave that up to your judgement.",False,19

If something asks him to place an instance somewhere using some SLA, then the scheduler will be really good at that.

But triggering the SLA miss (ie. detecting that we run out of space so we need to kill some spot instances) and acting on stopping instances (ie. deleting those spot instances) is not a scheduler responsibility.

In other words, I'm okay to have some distinction in Nova for spot instances vs. golden instances and some corresponding filters based on a specific tagging, but I don't want to have the cloud management based in Nova.

That backlog spec is pretty unclear of the differences between Nova and what should be done elsewhere, I think that's the first step (ie. a high-level diagram of share of responsibilities between projects) before moving further and discuss how we can do that in Nova.",False,19

I understood the problem this spec tries to solve, and the solution this spec proposes. It is convenient for our customers if several deploy methods can be used without restarting the conductor.

I felt a little bit uncomfortable to use the word ""MixIn"" in this context, because ""MixIn"" makes me associate with Multiple Inheritance in case of Python..

Software or program can be implemented in many ways.

So please take my comment as one of alternative implementations. At least I'd like you to add it into the ""Alternative"" section.

Intuitively I got the first impression that this would be the problem domain of what ""Multimethod or Multiple dispatch [1]"" is trying to solve.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch

If we create a Dispatch class like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Python

Dispatch class could take the role of ``deploy_type`` and would be further generic.

 Whether you're using one network or two there is an implication that there are firewall rules in place to control which hosts can access the control plane APIs. This spec obviates the need for any network access to be opened from the target node, aside from DHCP/PXE/IPXE, which can be moved to a separate host from the conductor.

>> Further, by having conductor make calls to IPA over https, with a signed certificate, the IPA client can ensure that it's receiving calls from a trusted source
 >This is not implemented yet IIRC, and without it this whole spec does not make much sense.
It's not implemented yet but it's the other spec i've alluded to a couple of times. We decided to leave it out of this spec to keep things simple. 

>> In this context, what value would a separate provisioning network provide?
>Protection from exploits, for example. Protection from tampering with inherently unprotected DHCP/PXE/iPXE traffic.

Our deployment plan separates the DHCP/PXE/IPXE traffic onto dedicated hosts which themselves have no ability to communicate with the conductor.

So our control flow is:

Conductor --> ipxe host <-->target node

And, finally, remember that in layer 3 networks your subnet is constrained to a single rack. So if you have a thousand racks, you need a thousand subnets. If you have two networks per rack, you need two thousand subnets. If you want to be able to do mass boots (we need to boot over 1K hosts at a time) then you need adequate IP space in each rack to allow every machine to boot simultaneously, or you need to create a provisioning system capable of only booting parts of racks at a time. 
 The complexity of that at scale far outweighs any advantages, particularly when our design flow above totally obviates the need for a provisioning network.",False,19

First of all thanks for your review.

Can you please check:

module puppet-neutron/manifests/agents/n1kv_vem.pp
...
# [*n1kv_source*]
#   (optional)
#     n1kv_source ==> VEM package location. One of below
#       A)URL of yum repository that hosts VEM package.
#       B)VEM RPM/DPKG file name, If present locally in 'files' folder
#       C)If not specified, assumes that VEM image is available in
#         default enabled repositories.

   enabled  => 1,
   gpgcheck => 1,
   gpgkey   => ""${n1kv_source}/RPM-GPG-KEY""
    #proxy   => '_none_',
 }

I was following this module. Parameter n1kv_source of class n1kv_vem already providing same manipulations with Cisco repositories like Mellanox agent module. Does our case is differnet than above ?

openstack/puppet-* modules aim to configure, install and run OpenStack applications and their dependencies that are also part of OpenStack (libraries, tools, etc).

However, we don't want to manage third-party software in our modules because:
* they are not part of OpenStack.
* they might conflict with OpenStack packaging (specific dependencies).
* we don't have third-party CI, so we can't test it, so we don't want that code.
* we think this code should be part an external module or the composition layer. Example in that case, a puppet-mlnx that would install repos and dependencies to deploy the right tools that Neutron needs.

In summary: pupet-neutron aims to configure neutron.conf and plugins.ini (whatever plugin that is supported by Neutron upstream), install any package needed by Neutron to run (agents, server, etc), manage Neutron services (agents, services, etc) but not external tools like: custom OVS, custom libraries, custom kernel versions, etc. which is something quite often required by recent SDN tools (which by the way makes sense!).

An example of this: https://github.com/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder/blob/master/tests/cmd/subcommands/test_test.py#L102-L132 tells you exactly where in the modules the mocking of os.walk and os.path.isdir is intended to affect so you know where to focus looking in the code.


Referencing the underlying module has the appearance of reaching in behind the curtain and changing internal behaviour instead of mocking where the object is being accessed. The effect may be ultimately the same, but it hides where in the code being tested it's intended to affect.


It does appear that in a number of cases nova is doing the exact same as here, nova/tests/unit/db/test_db_api.py mocks a number of methods under 'nova.db.sqlalchemy.api' which turn out to be mainly imports from sqlalchemy. Where they use @mock.patch.object('sqlalchemy_api', <function>) it turns out the functions are their internal ones instead of references to what is implemented by sqlalchemy.

As far as I can tell, there are multiple approaches being taken, sometimes the mock is directly on the system module being utilised, sometimes it's done using where the lookup occurs.

Without a better reason than less characters, it appears more beneficial to follow the recommendation from the mock documentation, and only deviate from that as and when needed.",False,19

2. I have never seen that advice you've linked to, and as I say, everything I've seen that uses mock mocks out from the underlying package.  This is, in fact, one of the reasons nova and other OpenStack projects enforce the convention of importing modules rather than symbols from modules.  I can definitely see the advantages of this advice in the case where you import the symbols, but that's not what we're doing here; in essence, ""jenkins.requests.Session.send"" is simply an alias for ""requests.Session.send"", and if you patch the former, you are *also* patching the latter.

Simple example of where this falls down:

test1.py
--

 class DummyClass(object):
     def method(self):
         return ""Hello World""


test2.py
--

 from test1 import DummyClass
 
 
 def create():
     d = DummyClass()
     print(d.method())

test.py
--

 import test2
 import test1
 import mock


 @mock.patch('test1.DummyClass')
 def example1(dummyclass_mock):
     dummyclass_mock.return_value.method.return_value = ""Goodbye World!""

     test2.create()

 example1()


Will print 'Hello World', change the patch to mock 'test2.DummyClass' and it'll print 'Goodbye World!'. This tends to catch people by surprise.

Use the following mock and you'll get 'Hello World'

 @mock.patch.object(test1, 'DummyClass')

Change to the following and you'll get 'Goodbye World'

 @mock.patch.object(test2, 'DummyClass')



When mocking methods on objects, you'll get the expected behaviour, but due to the quirks around mocking entire classes I've defaulted to using the recommendation from the mock docs to mock from where the object will be looked up so as to avoid surprises when switching between mocking the class versus methods.",False,19

Currently a decider works like the following:

When a edge with X decider(s) function(s) is determined to exist, inputs are extracted from engine storage, then those X decider(s) are called with the extracted inputs. If any of those decider(s) returns false then all successors of the potentially executing node are set to IGNORE state and IGNORE intention (which means they will never be executed).

Now instead we could change this to be more powerful. Perhaps providing the decider(s) function(s) the inputs *and* the successor nodes and letting the decider function(s) return which nodes should be set to IGNORE state and IGNORE intention. Then it can be up to the decider function(s) to determine if and which successors should be dropped and which ones shouldn't.

Downsides I can see:
 - deployments that haven't deployed the metadata service would need to do so to offer this facility. Because it can be deployed namespace-local (plus the other antispoof rules we have), it is secure against spoofing, tampering and interception.
 - baremetal metadata deployments are a little more complex - but per deployment solvable. It breaks down like this:
   - if the deployment is doing instance network isolation (like rackspace's onmetal does) then the metadata server is isolated and immune to hostile attack.
   - if the deployment is not doing instance network isolation, then either
     - its using an out of band boot mechanism (e.g. iLO)
        - which is not typically updateable
     - it is vulnerable to boot time attacks between instances

So basically we'd be raising the bar - requiring network isolation - for baremetal deployments that wanted to do this.

Actually, the issue about nova-compute launch slowly just happen on VMware driver, think about the following case:

1. 200 active instances run in one nova-compute host that map to one vCenter Cluster, batch delete them, all of them are in ""deleting"" task_state.

2. nova-compute process stop and restart when all instances is in ""deleting"" task_state.

3. nova-compute start to init 200 deleting instances one by one. The workflow of VMware driver is power-off instance, then wait task finish, then delete the instance.

4. After all the deleting instances are handled, nova-compute is set to ""up"" state, continue to work.

step 3 will spend lots of time on serial init_instance. In my performance test environment, the nova-compute spend about 15 minutes to finish init_instance.

Using qcow2 image to boot instance will result in falling back to the default fetch and thus won't give a you a clone but a default RBD image with layering.
Given that there is currently no mechanism (yet) to convert images during the upload we can not really conclude that ""they don't want to use cow clones"". We can't really force users to upload RAW images all the time so we will always end up in the mixed env with raw and qcow2 (till the glance patch for task triggers lands). Moreover users have no knowledge on what's running under the hood, so they just to care and simply do what's easier for them.
To me, it's not because the image is not a clone that we shouldn't attempt to create a RBD snapshot out of it.
If the operator sets 'image_type=rbd', I don't see any reasons why he/she will be reluctant to use RBD snapshots. I think it's worth double-checking. IMHO if we can get a location (just like this: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/imagebackend.py#L775) then we should use the pool and do the clone.

I tend to view that kind of deployment as a matter of symmetry: if they don't want to use copy-on-write clones to boot images, they probably don't want to use copy-on-write clones to snapshot them, either; and falling back to ""legacy"" behaviors is desirable.

But it might be worth it to clone the images anyways for the performance increase (and it borders on unsettling just how much faster it is to do it this way) which raises the question of what to do if the storage pool lookup fails twice: should it make the snapshot in-place, or give up and fall back?

If we used c.io interface for names, the name in the csr would be parsed into x509.Name object (_decode_x509_name_entry). In that code, the following happens (value = _asn1_string_to_utf8(backend, data)). While it's not incorrect and it's very convenient for reading the name fields, we lost the type of that string. We cannot guarantee anymore that when it's added to the resulting certificate it's going to have the same representation.

This matters because (RFC3280, page 21, yes I know it's not the latest RFC, but I bet many implementations use 2002 rules, not 2008):

      (a) attribute values encoded in different types (e.g.,
      PrintableString and BMPString) may be assumed to represent
      different strings;

And it could potentially break chain verification.

This is only one case of a general issue: if you strip asn1 data, you can't guarantee you serialise the same data.

Now, I'm not a X509/PKI/crypto expert - I'm happy for people to tell me I shouldn't worry about it, but every few pages I run into stuff like this and lean more and more towards the idea that the only sane way is to copy exact asn1 structure from CSR to X509 for names and extensions.",False,19

I suspect the underlying problem is that we are decoding a response that is not in utf-8 and has a different charset specified in the headers. So if instead of just assuming utf-8, we decoded the response based on what we're told to use to decode (provided we check that the return type is actually text), it would work as expected.

Other than that, I would be looking to change the code to register a custom response handler that is called each time, where the default is to decode the response using the charset from the headers.

But allowing to ignore the errors means that we are returning a potentially corrupted response instead, with no way for the caller to get the original response to do anything with it. That potentially renders the response worthless and at the same time adds another option to the API that must be supported in the future.

    response = urlopen(req, timeout=self.timeout).read()

We should probably really drop the .read() call and hold onto the response object returned by urlopen by using:

    response = urlopen(req, timeout=self.timeout)
    contents = response.read()
    if contents is None:
        ....

The response object then in this case is like a file object, but also contains the methods info(), getcode() and geturl() to retrieve addition information.

See https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html#high-level-interface for details. Basically the info() method returns an instance of mimetools.Message that can be queried using gettype() to determine the content type which will return 'text/plain' if none is defined. We should probably check this to ensure it starts with 'text/' before attempting to read the contents, and also before attempting to decode anything. i.e.

    if response.info().getmaintype() == 'text':
        # only read and decode text data

Additionally the mimetools.Message has a method getplist() (https://docs.python.org/2/library/mimetools.html#mimetools.Message.getplist) which will return everything in the header 'Content-Type: text/plain; <extra data>' listed in ""<extra data>"" which is exactly where the charset would be defined.

I would expect we should be getting the following header from Jenkins:

    Content-Type:text/xml; charset=utf-8

Reading the documentation on https://docs.python.org/2/library/mimetools.html#module-mimetools suggests that the following should be used to extract the expected charset:

        charset = response.info().getparam('charset')
        return contents.decode(charset)


Putting this altogether:

    response = urlopen(req, timeout=self.timeout)
    mimedata = response.info()
    if mimedata.getmaintype() == 'text':
        # only read and decode text data
        contents = response.read()
        # provide a default of utf-8 if it's missing
        charset = mimedata.getparam('charset') or 'utf-8'
        return contents.decode(charset)
    else:
        # return the raw contents, though this may not be a good idea
        # with a long stream of data
        return response.read()


However as you've stated this is still a little limited, so I would suggest placing from 'mimedata = response.info()' downwards into a _response_handler method on the object, and have the init function take a custom response_handler callback to use instead of the default.

This would allow for situations where we cannot predict how people will use the API calls to customize how the response is handled to their application usage.

Unfortunately digging through the documentation suggests that the above won't work on python 3, so it looks as though we probably also need to switch to using the requests library to be able to handle various responses.

It would be still be a useful information point if you can patch locally with the above suggestion to establish whether the idea works in your case. At the very least that may allow you to add some print statements to dump out information about what headers are defined and the charset detected.

I will look at converting the library to use ""requests"" instead, which will probably clean up a few things and provide a generic python 2/3 version of a response_handler and then this change could be co-opted to add support for a custom response_handler to be registered through the constructor.",False,19

Is this accurate?

If this is true, there is no way to know that the reboot is complete, correct? Only that the iRMC device has accepted the command and will issue the ACPI reboot command at some point in the future, correct?

If this is not true, then why is there an async flag?",False,19
187082,ironic/drivers/modules/irmc/power.py,13719,8,9a41bdd9_2759638e,Line,245,9a41bdd9_4a812bfa,2015-07-16 07:28:45,"* libraries are installed from PyPI, python-scciclient needs to do a new release to PyPI before this feature can be used.

I'll certainly do it for our customer.

* sleep(5) does not mean that the call blocks until the command is finished. It means it waits 5 seconds and returns. ACPI reboot can easily take more than 5 seconds.

sleep(5) or wait(5) is for mount virtual media, you'll know that if you read my reply in the patch #7 again.

* There is no ""suitable"" amount of time to wait -- as I understand it, ACPI reboot/shutdown is completely up to the operating system. If the OS wants to take 15 minutes to shut down, that's allowed. We need to figure out how to actually handle this -- maybe the best route is ""soft power off, poll until done, power on"".

Even if OS hangs, the line 256 ""node.target_power_state = states.NOSTATE"" is executed after wait(30) as I answered in the patch #7. Because SCCI call is async. SCCI is working in iRMC, not in OS. And let me note again, wait(30) secs is just an example.

If you are talking about the case that iRMC is hanged, SCCI call is just HTTP post, so request library throws exception within the client_timeout 60 secs.

https://github.com/NaohiroTamura/python-scciclient/blob/master/scciclient/irmc/scci.py#L266

In this case, the except at the line247 is called as I answered in the  patch #7 .

So all error cases you pointed out are covered by the current code.

If you still see some problem in the current code, I'd like you to advice me how should it be concretely.

* ACPI shutdown *can and will* hang forever. Maybe not in a lab environment where the world is perfect, but in real life it will happen. The kernel can ignore it, the OS can lock up, etc. There absolutely needs to be some form of timeout on this call (though that has been accidentally implemented by not being async).

This case is considered in the current code as I answered above.

* And we need a way for the user to find if the call has completed. Immediately after making this call, the state of the node will be (power_state=POWER_ON, last_error=None). This won't change unless the call errors. In the success case, it will remain exactly the same - the user doesn't see anything to indicate that the call has completed.

This function specification and implementation are based on the customer's request. 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1459913

They, cloud provider, said that they would like to shutdown their costumer's instance safely without logging on when they require unscheduled hardware maintenance.
One possible solution I can think of is that I can reject soft power off if the bare-metal node is not in maintenance mode.
If the node is in the maintenance mode, Ironic conductor periodic status check stops, so the problem Devananda pointed out originally doesn't happen, so we don't need wait(30) and customer can get the result immediately.",False,19

* How is it covered by the current code?

If os hang happens, after wait(30) in scci [1], then ""node.power_state = states.POWER_OFF"" at the line 257 is called, that makes conductor periodic status check thread hard power off the bare metal node consequently.

Thank you for the comment.

> I don't see the async argument being used in python-scciclient, nor any indication of what the async parameter does.

""async=False"" means that the call doesn't return until soft power off has been done. I used this option to set virtual media parameters and mount virtual media.

 https://github.com/openstack/ironic/blob/master/ironic/drivers/modules/irmc/deploy.py#L424-L425

I'm in the process of releasing the update version of scciclient which supports ""async=False"".


> Does it make the BMC block other commands etc?

No, BMC(iRMC) works concurrently.

> What about the ""power status"" command? 

It works in the process of soft power off.

> If that fails, it could cause Ironic to maintenance the node because it can't sync power state.

Okay, I understood, thanks for the information.

> Additionally, if this blocks other commands, what happens if this command gets stuck?  How would an operator/user recover from this case? 

I works concurrently, so it doesn't block any command.
The operator/user can take any action.

> Seems like there should be a timeout or something, maybe a fallback to hard power.

Yes, any error should go to SCCIClientError at the line 246. So the operator/user can issue hard power off in that case.

You are right, if Fujitsu customer tried the Ironic master code, iRMC driver won't wok.
So I merged the branch currently I'm working on to the master.

https://github.com/NaohiroTamura/python-scciclient/tree/master

> What if it just hangs forever instead of returning an error? 

Current implementation never hang. Because SCCI call is inherently async call, and ""async=False"" just calls wait(5) for mount virtual media right now. 

https://github.com/NaohiroTamura/python-scciclient/blob/master/scciclient/irmc/scci.py#L274

I'm thinking that the easiest implementation for Soft Power Off is to increase the waiting period to 30 secs in case of Soft Power Off. 30 secs is just an example, I have to verity the suitable number by experimenting in the Lab.

This implementation doesn't require another thread to manage timeout. So it's simple, we don't have to worry about affecting something bad to the main thread.
If Soft Power Off didn't completed within 30 secs, then
""node.power_state = states.POWER_OFF"" at the line 261 is called, then conductor periodic state monitoring thread does Hard Power Off.

If SCCI call failed, exception handling starting from the line 245 is called immediately, then  node.power_state stays states.POWER_ON.
Customer can check the current status by ""ironic node-show"".

AD=80: Neutron Router (e.g. default route to external GW, extra routes)

If wanted, we could offer means to override these default ADs through configuration (e.g. as parameters of the BGPVPN object or per static route).

If a Network with a subnet with prefix A is associated to a BGPVPN that advertises B:

- traffic from the Network subnet A to an address that is in A will be forwarded inside the subnet at L2 (even if the address is also in B)  ==> no issue

- traffic in the VPN to an address that is both in A and B will follow the longest match route (we are not changing this semantic) ==> no issue

- for traffic from another subnet C also associated to the same Network, to a prefix that is both in A and B, if C and A are connected to a Router, then there is an overlap issue

* Sorry, the commit message says ""soft reboot"", so I was thinking this is a reboot, not a power off. That should be changed.

Oops, I'm sorry, I'll fix that.

* I think if async=false is used, the scci client should poll until the actual state is ""power off"". Calling wait() to pretend to be async seems pretty bad.

Generally speaking, you are right. It would be best if it polled, But I think that wait() is enough and tolerable in practical usage in this specific case, because both os hang and iRMC hang are covered by the current error handling code, and the possibility of the happing hangs is very small by design of this particular vendor hardware and software.

* What happens if the agent is not installed, or not running? Does the call to iRMC return an error? Or does the machine just never power down (since the call to iRMC is asynchronous)?

iRMC returns the following error code immediately.

<Severity>Error</Severity>
<Error Context=""SCCI"" OC=""RequestShutdownAndOff"" OE=""0"" OI=""0"">ServerView Agent not connected</Error>

I have just now learned that this isn't ACPI power; this is a vendor thing that requires an agent installed. What happens if the agent is not installed, or not running?

* I'm confused -- I'm under the impression that when a request is made to iRMC, the response is ""ok, I will do this"" and the command is performed after the response is returned. Is this accurate?

Yes, it's accurate.

* If this is true, there is no way to know that the reboot is complete, correct? 

Yes, it's correct without issuing another command.

Let me note again, this vendor specific implementation doesn't support ""soft reboot"", but ""soft power off"".

* Only that the iRMC device has accepted the command and will issue the ACPI reboot command at some point in the future, correct?

Basically Yes.

Let me note, the word ""ACPI reboot"" is a little bit unambiguous. If it means IPMI ""Set ACPI Power State Command"" and acpid in OS, it's not the case of iRMC SCCI. 
iRMC SCCI uses vendor extended way between iRMC and system main board and requires vendor specific agent to be installed.

* If this is not true, then why is there an async flag?

This is true.

Let me note, all of SCCI cmds (http post) are async, so ""async=false"" just mimics sync call using wait() in current implementation.

I think that we need to look at other possibilities and I'm not sure that associating the static routes to the BGPVPN resource is the right approach.

First, we could associate the static routes to a BGVPNNetworkAssociationresource.

We could also leverage existing constructs:
- allowed_address_pairs is an existing property that can be defined on a Neutron Port and allows to define which MAC/IP prefix can be sourced from a Neutron port : we could leverage this, and ue the said prefixes as satitc routes on the Network to which the Port is plugged to
- if we don't want to overload the semantic of allowed_address_pair  we could also add an Extension Driver to associate static routes to a Port (but I note that allowed_address pair will also need to be defined to actually let the POrt send traffic from the said prefixes)
- we could also add an Extension Driver to associate static routes to a Network

All the above is ""food for thought"" as this point.

- I'm running a big MySQL server on some bare metal
- I request a graceful shutdown using this vendor extension
- driver uses SCCI, which passes the request to iRMC, which initiates graceful shutdown of the server
- mysqld process receives SIGTERM and begins flushing buffer pool. this process takes 20 minutes because it's a very large, busy server
- driver sets node power state to POWER_OFF
- driver waits for 5 seconds (or 30 seconds) then releases its exclusive lock
- within the next minute, ironic-conductor main thread starts the power status sync loop, calls node.driver.power.get_power_state, which returns POWER_ON
- since actual_state POWER_ON != expected_state POWER_OFF, ironic-conductor main thread calls node.driver.power.set_power_state(POWER_OFF) initiating ** OMG A HARD SHUT DOWN **
- my MySQL database is corrupted and I'm very sad

* rely on the cloud providers. Maybe they already have their own mirrors and could be part of the larger CDN?  This way when requesting something like clouds.centos.org  you end up hitting the cloud provider local mirror.  Highly speculative and would require the provider to do the mirroring work + attach it to the global CDN.
