is the idea we're returning 503 to the client but don't want to LOG it as a server error if the generator gets a ChunkWriteTimeout?  We mostly return 499 on PUT right, do we really ever expect a 503 (with a proxy_logging_status 429) to have a generator body?",False,49

it's hard to argue with the mw interface returning the proxy_logging_status environ value, but if there's a situation where we might set the value in the req environ and only later discover we want to return a different value we may have to change the interface which sounds annoying.",True,49
