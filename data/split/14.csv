Sorry, I don't quite follow how this patch is breaking ALL subnet-less network in your env. Currently, your not able to boot an instance on a network that does not have a subnet through nova. With this patch it will allow you to do that if the network is marked as port_security_enabled=False. 

About your reference to here: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/b8dace6a9ca6dda8fbf72435be274b2848bbcbb3/nova/network/security_group/neutron_driver.py#L385

This is slightly a different case in that case it's handling the scenario where a security group is being 'Added' to an instance. In this case we're validating that a network has a subnet and the right port security settings before nova creates a port (with the default security group that nova adds).",False,14

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/havana/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#L581

However, in icehouse that check was added in this patch:

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/79801/

This changed the behavior of subnet-less networks in icehouse vs havana (ie, disallowed them).  For us, we were broken because we create DHCP networks as subnet-less networks.  To work around this, we overrode the validate_networks method (cut and pasted it and just removed that subnets check)... which is messy and just waiting for problems since we'll not get new community changes in the overridden method.  Thus, we were hoping we'd be able to revert back to community code with THIS patch, based on your commit message in the prior patch (79801 linked to above):

""Note: a patch to fix the neutron port-security-enabled extension will
follow which allows one to boot instances on networks without subnets
and ports without fixedips.""

Which sounded promising, but didn't quite pan out that way.  It doesn't work because our networks, created on havana, didn't have the port_security_enabled attribute set (since we're using a non-port_security_enabled plugin - ML2... I misspoke in my last response when I said OVS...) and thus the default of ""True"" here is causing it to fail.  Using a default of True is not compatible with subnet-less networks created in havana that never set the port_security_enabled attribute.

This is why I say it seems a migration script is needed.  If you don't set port_security_enabled to False in these havana-created networks, they'll fail on icehouse.  This is an inconsistency between icehouse and havana.",False,14

By default when you create a port on a neutron network: ip/mac spoofing is automatically on this is the reason why if the port_security_enabled attribute on the network is not found (i.e one is using a plugin that does not support it) we set it to True.

This seems directly related to the injection of  the guest conf file from the taskmanager, but I could move this to a separate bug and patch if folks prefer. 

The primary issue with the current default is not the .sample extension but rather the $pybasedir. The taskmanager injection of this conf file is optional: it checks if the specified guest_config file exists, and if so injects it into the guest image at boot. 

However we are defaulting to a file in the trove src tree that /always/ exists (and is intended as a template only). If you were to create a guest image with its own guest conf properly configured, the current default would cause your conf to be overwritten by the sample.

I suggest:
 - the sample file remains where it is with the same extension
 - the default option should be changed as I've proposed

This means that:
 - If the user tailors all the /etc/trove/*conf files on their controller node, the right thing will happen and the tailored guest conf will be injected. 
 - If the user chooses to only tailor guest conf on their images, they don't have to worry about a sample file being injected over the top.",False,14

interfaces seems like a nice place to put the contracts that plugins might choose to enforce.

As to default/external - I'm open to different names.  Those were just the first ones that popped to mind.

But the idea of default is for it to be the existing barbican infrastructure (with its second level of stevedore)  The idea would be to take what is currently in crypto and duplicate it essentially unchanged in that location.

The assert is testing what you are already mocking. And the assert_called_with just tests the param you are passing. Not sure if these tests is useful. Looking at the logic for UpgradeNotification.create, it is mostly validating the params. So i would change this test to test the exceptions thrown depending on the params but you already covered this in test_validate.

I say just remove these tests since they are not doing anything useful and the logic for create doesnt really need tests.

The only test i would have here is the test_validate",False,14

User error? Or a bug in generateXML?

It also occurs to me that it's not obvious that generateXML would populate self.jobs (a side effect) or that it would apply filtering. So I feel like probably some refactoring might be nice. I hesitate to make my code depend on generateXML populating self.jobs because that is an undocumented side effect and that could easily go away if someone refactors that function. I would rather use a functional style where I use the return values of functions only and not side effects. Ideally, I wouldn't even call generateXML because I don't really need to generate XML just to browse or list jobs.",False,14
